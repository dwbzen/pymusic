'''
 MarkovChain is an implementation of a discreet-time Markov Chain (DTMC) with memory.
 It undergoes transitions from one state to another on a state space, 
 with the probability distribution of the next state depending only on the current state
 and not on the sequence of events that preceded it.
 The states are T instances, transitions from state T1 to state T2 are K instances
 each transition has an associated probability and additional information
 used by classes that generate Ts.</p>
  
 The order of the MarkovChain is the number of states that determine future states.
