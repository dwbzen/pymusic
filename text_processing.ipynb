I am passionately in love with Kathy, the eldest sister and a stunning redhead with countless freckles, but not quite sure what to do about it except stammer and blush. I try to explain about bringing power to the masses with a network of overhead wires, telephone poles, and transformers. Kathy, the more sophisticated of the trio, tells me that the scheme can't possibly work because there are no wires from the main line. I don't get it, so she points to the telephone pole that sits on the property line between our houses. \n",
      "\n",
      "20 \t“You need to get juice from somewhere,” she says. \n",
      "\n",
      "21 \tI should have thought of that, but rather than admit it, I tell her that I'm going to make a splice that very afternoon. They all think I'm joking, but I demonstrate my manly electrical belt and show off my tools to convince them. I suspect that Kathy is still skeptical, but she doesn't show it. The girls bid me a fond bon voyage with a chorus of “Lipstick on Your Collar.”\n",
      "\n",
      "22 \n",
      "\n",
      "23 \tI stand at the base of the pole and stare up — it's miles high. There's the transformer, near the top. I check my engineering and decide that's where I'll make the splice. The Stevens girls sit on the fence awaiting my ascent. As I start up the pole, I imagine Kathy's bright green eyes following my dangerous path up the splintered pole and whispering “my hero” to her sisters. \n",
      "\n",
      "24 \tMy tool belt, designed for a body a whole lot wider than mine, hangs low around my waist and bumps against the pole at each step, making it difficult to balance on those short metal spikes that pretend to be a ladder. I finally reach the base of a large transformer; two more steps and I'll reach the junction of high-tension wires. A light breeze sways the pole, and looking down I see that I must be hundreds of feet aboveground. The Stevens girls look like ants on a toothpick. I have an irresistible urge to nail that wiseass Louie with a major loogie. The temptation fizzles when I smell something burning. I look up and, just above my head, a steady stream of smoke is pouring out of the transformer. The wires all look like they're attached okay, so it must be something inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "25 \tOne more step and I'm even with the transformer. It seems bigger than I had thought, easily large enough to fit me inside. A quick look around and I find the large handle on top marked “To open—pull up.” I remember Pa's advice about transformers, but a little peek can't hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "26 \tIt takes a couple strong pulls to flip open the top; a noxious cloud of green smoke spews out. I cough, wave away the smoke, and peer inside. Still can't see a thing. I climb a bit higher for a better view, but my oversized belt catches on a stray nail. A careful tug doesn't help, so I give the belt a hearty yank, loose my balance, and tumble headfirst into the dark guts of the transformer. \n",

      "\n",
      "28 \t“There's no bottom to this thing,” I say after several minutes of descent. My words crackle with a hollow, metallic echo. All around me, bolts of electricity dart around, coming from out of nowhere and disappearing into the distance. My own body glows, and it doesn't take too long to figure out that I can flutter around like bolts of electric power.\n",
      "\n",
      "29 \t“I must be riding the electric current,” I say, delighting in the fiendish, crackling sound of my own voice. I grab a small bolt of current and an instant later find myself part of some machinery. Even though trapped and circulating about in the thing, I can sense where I am—inside the Stevens girls' television set. The sensation is like looking out into a room through swirling layers of shattered glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "30 \tThey must have gotten bored waiting for me on that fence and gone inside. I wave feverishly trying to attract their attention. Linda sneaks up closer to the screen. A second later, she screams and bolts from the room. I have no idea what she saw, but it must have been pretty weird. Her sisters move in closer to investigate. Louie stares right at me; her mouth drops open in fear or amusement, I can't tell which.\n",
      "\n",
      "31 \tKathy jumps back and shouts, “Mom, that Bacon kid did something to the TV.” She turns back to me and says, “What's wrong with you?” A quick flip turns the set off, sending me back through the wires and killing my first romance before it ever gets started.\n",
      "\n",
      "32 \tAnother bolt screams by, bigger and more powerful than that last one. From my experience with the Stevens girls, it seems like I'm inside another television set. My view is a jumbled mass of images, as if I were being tossed around in a tight loop. It stops suddenly and, through a pinhole view, I see the inside of a living room or den. The scene is warped, like looking through a fishbowl, but I can see the figure of a little girl approaching the set. She screws up her face staring at me. The little girl disappears from view, and a finger appears. It pokes at my image several times. An instant later, a tremendous crackling noise, a flash of light, and a surge of power throws me back into the power grid.\n",

      "34 \tIn a cramped apartment across town, a little girl sits cross-legged in front of her TV set watching an episode of Mickey Mouse Club. The image flickers as cartoon characters sing, “Who's the leader of the club that's made for you and me?” She sits up and stares at the set. The picture rolls, flutters, and then disappears into a tiny bright dot at the center of the screen.\n",

      "\n",
      "37 \t“Darn it,” the girl mutters under her breath. She taps the top of the set and pokes at the center of the picture tube. Nothing happens, so she swats the side of the set, imitating the technique her dad had used last time the TV went on the fritz. A fuzzy image of a distorted face appears, followed by a pair of hands, as if someone were trapped inside and trying to get out. She jumps back, startled.\n",
      "\n",
      "38 \t“Who are you?” she says to the screen.\n",
      "\n",

      "44 \tThe TV is an old model Philco with a thirteen-inch screen. Diane's dad bought it a few years ago from a friend for twenty bucks and a beer. It was always acting up, but it was all the family could afford. A bang on the side usually nudged whatever was loose inside back into place—but not this time. A surge of power rips though the TV's fragile electronics the moment she hits the set. The power surge fuses the circuit and blows out the tubes. They explode one after another like a string of fireworks. When the surge hits the picture tube, it fractures and explodes in a hailstorm of glass that blows the little girl across the room.\n",

I focus on my surroundings and realize that I must be in Grandpa's electric shaver—the one with the “floating heads.” Since I seem to be stuck here, I decide to have a little fun at Pa's expense. As he lifts the shaver, I take over and run over his face in random spots, and then I start shaving his head. He grabs the shaver, but I slip free like a bar of wet soap.\n",

Just then, another bolt carries me into more machinery. This time I seem to be in some sort of motor. I try to escape, yet the harder I try, the faster the motor runs. I can hear my grandparents' panicky voices. They sound upset about something, and the harder I try to get out, the more upset they sound. I make one last push to escape. There's a sudden loud noise, like a balloon bursting, and then everything explodes in a shower of sparks and water. A moment later, I'm sitting in a vast puddle of water surrounded by mountains of soap suds. I stare up, dumbfounded, at the open door of Grandma's washing machine.\n",

      "64 My best friend Maxi spends the night at my house. I make him take the bed with the Dale Evans bedspread, where my little sister usually sleeps. I take the Roy Rogers bed and give him a hard time, calling him Dale in a girly sort of voice and asking if he can ride sidesaddle. He slams me across the face with a stuffed bear. I jump into his bed and pummel him with a Mister Rabbit hand puppet—a genuine likeness with a hard button nose. It raises welts on Maxi's head, so he pounds me some more; and we make so much racket that it wakes my sister up, and she starts crying which starts my mom yelling which starts my dad yelling. \n",
      "\n",
      "65 \tIt reminds me of a movie we saw in science class. There's this room with about a million mousetraps loaded up with ping-pong balls. Everything is pretty quiet until some scientist type in a white lab coat tosses a ping-pong ball right into the center, and soon there are balls bouncing all over the place. He explained that we were witnessing a chain reaction—that's how an atom bomb works; and if we're not careful, the Russians will drop one on us, and everyone in the world will bounce around just like those ping-pong balls. Except there is no scientist here, only my dad, and he is fed up and pissed off.\n",

      "\n",
      "111 \tI miss the rest of Maxi's explanation, mesmerized by his discovery in a jar. Inside, three kaleidoscope-colored creatures resembling slugs or snails crawl all over each other. They have a soft insect-like shell and wings folded around their bodies like a praying mantis. Funny thing is, they don't have a proper face or any eyes. Instead, they have large gaping mouths lined with rows of human-like teeth on top of a long stalk of a neck. Eyes or none, they seemed to look right through me. \n",
      "\n",
      "112 \tI back away, and Maxi says, “They're okay, really—don't bite or anything.” He carefully opens the lid. \n",

      "115 \tMaxi's flying creatures bounce from wall to wall, leaving solid vapor trails of red, yellow, and gold, as well as a sticky residue wherever they land. Maxi jumps around and claps his hands in excitement as we try to catch them, but they pass through our hands like smoke. We leap from bed to bed in a pointless exercise of recapturing his freaky pets. \n",

Their faces are painted in jagged streaks of black and yellow. My mom and Mrs. Kaplan are wearing these outrageous costumes with enormous masks. The whole scene reminds me of something I saw in National Geographic magazine.\n",

I can't tell at this distance, but it looks like some kind of animal, a monkey maybe. When he reaches the top step, my dad starts chanting in a language that sounds more like coughing than words. He pulls the monkey from his back and holds the limp creature over his head while Mr. Kaplan echoes the chant. My mom and Mrs. Kaplan are lying face down at the foot of the ladder. At the peak of the ceremony, the men throw the monkey into the air where it suddenly sparks to life. Just then our space pets find the window and streak out into the night, leaving glowing trails behind them. They circle the party in my backyard before taking off into the night sky. Maxi and I, my parents, and the Kaplans all stare into the heavens as the creatures' trails fade into the distance and disappear.\n",

Maxi gives me a sideways glance as he slowly moves away. I inch in the opposite direction, but the figure stays focused on me, screaming the same thing over and over.

      "\n",
      "207 \tThe two of them fly down Main Street, past the Land Museum, past the Batavia Town Hall, to the granite war memorial at the intersection of Main and Prospect. The cop jumps off my bike. It sails into the memorial at top speed, bending the front fender and knocking off a training wheel. My poor bike falls into a mechanical heap at the foot of an epitaph carved into the stone that honors Genesee County civil war veterans. The cop has no trouble overtaking Terry. He slaps on a pair of cuffs and pushes him into a waiting patrol car. I hear Terry threaten, “I'm gonna tell my dad,” as they drive him off to the poky.\n",
      "\n",
      "208 \tThe cops, the kids—no one has much interest in me; so I slowly walk my bike home, as it's in no condition to ride, knowing I will never have another bike for the rest of my life. \n",
      "\n",
      "209 \tI have this idea to park my bike someplace and sneak into the house; maybe no one will notice. No such luck. My mom is puttering around with some plants in the front yard, and my pop is mowing the lawn. He sees me coming, stops what he's doing, walks over, and inspects my bike. He doesn't say a word, just looks up and down the crumpled frame and bends over for a closer look at the flat front tire and scraped back fender. I wait, thinking that if he doesn't say something pretty quick, I'm going to piss my pants right there in front of him.\n",

      "213 \t“So he was involved in this? I should have known. Damn shittin' kids! Did he put you up to this?” My mom frowns, so I know not to use that excuse—better attempt the real explanation. \n",
      "\n",
      "214 \t“Well . . . uh . . . you see, Dad, we were just standin' around and . . . uhm . . . some ghost or angel or something appeared on the wall out of nowhere, and she made us roll our bikes down the hill into the wall, and we did and . . . uhm . . . she disappeared. So Maxi left, and I was on my way home, but some pirates kidnapped me—big kids on bikes, fourth graders with some kid named Terry—and they were gonna rob Mancuso's, so they made me go with them, and I did, and . . . uhm . . . the cops found out about it, and one of them took my bike and was chasing Terry and wrecked it when he drove it into the monument downtown.”\n",
      "\n",
      "215 \tMy dad looks at me suspiciously, “Ghost, huh? Pirates?” He circles me like a vulture looking to pluck out a ripe organ.  “Whataya think I am?

      "\n",
      "218 Maxi and I form a club so secret that we are the only members. We draft rules, regulations, and arcane initiation rites drawing from sources as varied as the Latin mass and Bugs Bunny cartoons. We write them all down in red crayon on that funky three-line paper used to teach cursive writing at school and then lock the whole thing away in a shoe box that we bury in an underground vault deep in Maxi's sandbox . . .\n",
      "\n",
      "219 \tThis is unfortunate as when it comes time to actually perform said rites and initiate ourselves, we remember very little of what they actually were; and to make matters more desperate, we have lost the technology for unearthing our mythic past.\n",
      "\n",
      "220 \tSo we improvise; and between the two of us, we decide that in order to join the club, you first have to collect twenty spiders (my idea) and put them all in a jar so that they fight like gladiators in the Coliseum. Next, squash any spiders that live through the carnage along with a variety of poisonous berries to create a sort of sacred goo (Maxi's idea). The final step is to smear the sacred goo over your chest in the light of a full moon while chanting the secret initiation rite. I want to use Latin—pull something appropriate from my daily missal—but Maxi nixes that idea (I think Protestants have a natural distrust of Catholic ritual). We try to write something ourselves, but it comes out sounding too goofy; and how do you harness the power of the universe with a second-grade vocabulary? Can't be done; so to save time, we pick words at random from Look magazine and my mom's anatomy textbook:\n",

He tells me the best places for spider hunting are dark and cool. The cool part should be no problem this early in April with temperatures hovering in the upper forties. I tell Maxi that it's too cold, but he tells me that now is the best time of year for spider hunting as they are just coming out of hibernation. I had no idea spiders hibernated.\n",
      "\n",
      "234 \tIn our quest for dark places, the best we come up with is the crawl space under my porch. I grab a flashlight and, side by side on our bellies, we squeeze ourselves under the thickly painted cross-hatched guard around the porch. With our legs sticking out in the open behind us, we search the dark crevices and find plenty in the way of web, but little in the way of spiders.

      "\n",
      "238 \t“Nothin', Ma,” I say having been sworn to secrecy. My mom studies the empty jar in my hand. She is about to say something when my dad comes out of the house leading my little sister by the hand, smoking a cigarette, and muttering under his breath.\n",
      "\n",

      "241 \tI know there's going to be trouble whenever Sister Damian starts off with, “We have a surprise today, children,” and today is no exception. She postures from her perch in front of the class—a black and white Statue of Liberty, her head encased in the halo of a huge semicircular headdress, her long black robes concealing religious mysteries. She seems to sail down the aisle to the storage closet where she extracts a box of some new mischief she has planned for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "242 \t“These are just some of the prizes you can win by selling Easter seals.” Everyone sits up, their hair standing on end as if a bolt of electricity just ripped through the classroom. No one wants to sell anything, especially Easter seals, especially when the best prize is a foot-high statue of the Virgin and that's the best prize. She fills in the details as if planning a family vacation: each book of twenty seals costs one dollar, that's a nickel a seal. Sell a book, get a prize certificate boasting of your participation in the Easter Seals Campaign of 1959. Sell five books, get a bigger prize and a fancier certificate. Sell forty books, get the foot-high statue of the Virgin and a plenary indulgence. Plenary indulgence? Is she kidding? What is any self-respecting second grader meant to do with a plenary indulgence? I'm not even old enough to sin properly. We collectively groan; this is grade school door-to-door hell. She seems to read our thoughts and says in a cheery voice, “Think of it as your initiation into the community of the body of Christ. Now, how many books does everyone want? Shall we start with ten?”\n",

      "243 \tSo armed with twenty books (I have no idea how she talked me into that), I drag my butt across St. Mary's school yard and hook up with Maxi on his way home from Robert Morris School. Not being Catholic, he doesn't get the whole Easter-seal drama but is willing to help out.\n",

      "\n",
      "256 \tI set out on my Easter-seal campaign around three in the afternoon, armed with forty books (Sister Damian talked me into taking yet another twenty), an envelope for collecting my booty, and a simple strategy: try every house on this side of the street, and when I hit Main street, come back up the other side. I also have my spider jar with me, just in case I find any along the way. The first stop is at my neighbor's, the O'Reilys. Mrs. O'Reily is a nice middle-aged sort, thick Italian accent (her husband is Irish), known in the neighborhood for giving away hoards of candy at Halloween. I walk boldly to the door, knock three times, and stand there patiently waiting, practicing my pitch in my head—“G'morning, Mrs. O'Reily, would you like to support Catholic charities by buying a book of Easter seals? Only one dollar a book. Can I put you down for two?” \n",
      "\n",
      "257 \tIt sounds pretty hokey, so I say it over a few more times while I wait. I knock again and listen for any sounds. Inside I hear a man's voice, muffled at first, then louder. \n",
      "\n",
      "258 \t“Who the hell is that?” a man's voice says. He sounds angry; probably Mr. O'Reily, who is not someone I've had any contact with as he rarely makes an appearance. More sounds, louder; a woman's voice, Mrs. O'Reily's, saying something to her husband. “Well, go see who the hell it is,” he says in a rough tone that carries through the door. I am about to turn around when I hear something thrown against the door, followed by a cry from Mrs. O'Reily. I inch slowly back, hoping to make a quick escape, when I hear the mister yell, “Don't give me that by-god piece of shit excuse. Just see who it is.” \n",
      "\n",
      "259 \tThe door slowly opens. Mrs. O'Reily pokes her head out and looks around; her eyes are red, and there is an ugly black bruise on her face just below her eye. She searches the porch, biting her lip and squinting, her mouth drawn tight across her face as if it were pasted on. When she finds me, she smiles a little smile and wipes away the moisture in her eyes. She says in a cheery voice to her husband inside, “It's Donnie Bacon from next door.”\n",
      "\n",
      "260 \tSeveral moments of silence before I hear, “So what does that little brat want?”\n",
      "\n",
      "261 \tRight now I want to bolt off that porch and down the street, but Mrs. O'Reily catches my pleading face and says in a sweet voice, “What can I help you with, sweetheart?”\n",
      "\n",
      "262 \tI make a somewhat abbreviated pitch. She relays the information inside and waits. \n",
      "\n",
      "263 \tI wait and shuffle my feet and wiggle my fingers to keep them warm.\n",
      "\n",
      "264 \tA few minutes later, the door swings open, and there in front of me is Mr. O'Reily himself. I've only seen him once or twice, and somehow I was expecting a foul-breathed, hung-over jamoke. That would have matched the voice better than the tall, impeccably groomed jasper that actually appears. I stare at him as I might if Sister Damian were to suddenly start talking like Donald Duck. He leans over and smiles a greasy smile, and with a gentle push edges his wife back.\n",
      "\n",
      "265 \t“So what do we have here?” he says, purposely, I think, exaggerating his already weedy Irish accent. “Easter seals, you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "266 \t“Yes, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "267 \tHe stares up and down at me, a thin-lipped smile nearly jumping off his face. Turning to his wife with a patient sneer, he growls, “Go get five dollars from your purse.” At first she seems dumbfounded, but he kicks her into high gear with a breathy, “Hurry the hell up, goddamnit.” Looking back at me, he says, “Future salesman, are you? Your dad must be very proud.”\n",
      "\n",
      "268 \t“Yes, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "269 \t“I should have such a son.”\n",
      "\n",
      "270 \t“Sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "271 \tHe stoops down and takes me by the shoulders and breathes into my face; his breath was a fog of clove-scented chewing gum. “We don't have any children, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "272 \tI wait for the missus to return with the cash, and with O'Reily's face inches from mine, I think it best to keep up the chatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "273 \t“Well, that's okay, I guess. Maybe you can . . .” I stop there. Fear has pushed me this far and, having reached the very edge of my knowledge about kids and what-not, I cautiously back away. \n",
      "\n",
      "274 \tHe stands back up and takes a cigarette from a silver case that he has in his back pocket. He lights it with the patience of a surgeon and says through a thin smile, “No, I can't. You see, my wife . . . well, you wouldn't understand, but it's a problem. See?”\n",
      "\n",
      "275 \tFinally Mrs. O'Reily returns. At first she seems unsure of just who to hand the money to, but she finally hands it to her husband who snatches it with the speed of a mousetrap from her hands. She flinches and backs away. He hands me the money.\n",
      "\n",
      "276 \t“So what will this buy, my fine young man?”\n",
      "\n",
      "277 \t“Five books, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "278 \t“Fine. Fine.” I hand him the five books; he looks them over and then pushes them toward his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "279 \t“Well, you run along now and sell your stamps. Tell your father I said hello.”\n",
      "\n",
      "280 \tHe closes the door, ever so slowly, smiling all the while. I turn to leave, but something keeps me there for a few moments longer. After a couple of minutes, I hear more shouting from the inside. The yelling becomes screaming and crying. Something hard hits the door. I put my ear to the door and hear Mrs. O'Reily's voice, “No, please, please . . .” Something else hits the door and shatters. I clutch my five dollars in terror and bolt.\n",
      "\n",
      "281 Mrs. Howard\n",
      "\n",
      "282 \tI run past the next two houses, wanting to get as far away as possible from the O'Reily place. Her cries still echo in my head as I reach the porch steps of the Howards' house. Mrs. Howard is young— my mom's age or a little bit older—pretty, petite, a widow from the stories I've heard. Grandpa told me all about it—she murdered her husband; chopped him up into little pieces and buried him in the backyard. Now I don't know if this is true or not. My grandfather has a story about everyone, and she seems nice enough whenever she does come out, which is rare. I think he's just trying to scare me, and it didn't help when he told me that she had some kind of monster in the house. \n",
      "\n",
      "283 \t“That's why she killed her husband,” he told me. “Fathered her a monster—two heads, three eyes, born without a backbone, slithers on a layer of slime like a human snail.” It scared the crap out of me, but I don't really believe it, and so I traipse up to the door and give her doorbell a manly push. A pleasant but unfamiliar five-note refrain echoes inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "284 \tAfter a short wait, the door cracks open an inch or two, and half a face appears silhouetted against a black background. From the shadow, a disembodied voice says, “Can I help you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "285 \tThe strangeness of the greeting pushes my Easter-seal pitch momentarily from my head. I stand there and stammer, looking for an escape, but finally blurt out, “Would you like to buy some Easter seals?” My voice cracks at the end like nails on a chalkboard.\n",
      "\n",
      "286 \tThe eye scans up and down. Behind the door I hear scraping, scratching. The eye darts down in that direction; the figure at the door seems to push something aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "287 \t“Easter seals? Oh yes, of course. You must go to Saint Mary's school.” She has a hypnotic voice that lulls me into a senseless calm. “You're the Bacon boy, from down the street.”\n",
      "\n",
      "288 \tA scraping against the bottom of the door—like a small animal, a dog maybe, trying to claw its way free—distracts me.\n",
      "\n",
      "289 \t“Well?” the voice says.\n",
      "\n",
      "290 \t“Yes, ma'am, I mean, Mrs. Howard.” From inside I hear a gurgling sound. It makes me think of squashing a giant slug slowly on a slick pavement with bare feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "291 \t“How much?” she says quickly. I quote my price—more scratching, and the sound of something sniffing, like a small animal; the door shakes slightly like something was pushing from behind. The eye darts around some more, and half a mouth says, “I'll take . . . ten.”\n",
      "\n",
      "292 \tI dig out ten books and pass them through the thin crack to a pair of slender hands with long, painted nails; they disappear and are almost immediately replaced by a crisp ten-dollar bill, as if she had it ready all the time. I take it with a curt “thanks,” and the door closes, slowly, quietly. I stand there feeling incomplete, like something else should be happening but nothing does; except the scraping that was behind the door disappears, and a strange, misshapen figure and several eyes appears at the window. Or does it? Before I can get a closer look, the blinds close, locking me out.\n",

      "294 \tNext house is the Kaplans'. They're friends of my parents, so I expect to dump a few books here. I ring the bell, and as I wait, I notice a web above the door sill. With Maxi's spider count well ahead of mine, I can't afford to shun any opportunity. And so with mason jar in hand, I drag over a shaky chair and climb up for a closer look. Nuzzled solemnly in the corner of the chaotic web is an enormous black spider. Jesus, it must be an inch long and weird too; her fat body is flanked with silver streaks. I slowly reach up, gently flatter the creature into my jar, and quickly close the top. Well, I lived through that okay, so I reach back up into the web. There are more, but not just one; there must be twenty—no, more—hundreds of spiders! They all fall onto my head, into my stocking hat; and the only thing I can think to do is to kill them, smash them to death. I jump off the chair and beat my head against the door, over and over, smashing each and every one of them, yelling all the while, too terrified to even think about my Easter seals. Bang, bang! I beat my head, taking no chance that any remain alive, when the door opens and an old woman appears.\n",
      "\n",
      "295 \tI look up, for the moment forgetting the nest of spiders, and gape at the figure hovering over me. It's the old lady, Mrs. Warner. I think she's Mrs. Kaplan's mom, or maybe even her grandma. I remember her from the time her mutant dog ran Maxi and me up a tree. My heart sinks as I realize that I have to deal with her and not my parents' friends. In one hand, she wields a smoldering cigarette in a pearl holder like a weapon; in the other, a cocktail glass filled with clinking ice and a vile-smelling drink the color of ice tea. Her outfit is outrageous: tight-fitting pink pedal pushers, half-open silk blouse revealing an inch or two of wrinkled cleavage, silver-gray hair puffed up to enormous proportions, red ankle-high boots, rings adorning each finger that collectively must weigh a pound, and makeup so thick you could write your name in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "296 \t“Well? What do you want?” she says, forcing out each syllable. She takes a lethargic drag from her cigarette and blows a pasty smoke ring in my direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "297 \t“I'm selling Easter seals for St. Mary's school . . .” I start, but she interrupts me.\n",
      "\n",
      "298 \t“What's your name?” she snaps, then immediately answers her own question. “You're that Bacon kid that lives down the street.” A broad, gaudy smile crosses her face. “You're the boy that teased my Elektra, isn't that so, my precious?” she says to a dog hidden somewhere behind the door. Her demeanor suddenly changes as if the nice pill suddenly wore off. “So, what do you want?”\n",
      "\n",
      "299 \tI remember telling her this, but because she's a potential customer, I repeat myself and remind her about the Easter seals.\n",
      "\n",
      "300 \t“Oh yeah,” she growls. Two thin streams of smoke leak from her enlarged nostrils as if she were some sick, lamenting dragon. “Well, come in and show me what you got.” I set my jar of spiders down on the porch. She pokes the cigarette holder back into her mouth, grabs me by the arm, and drags me inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "301 \tShe slowly closes the door behind me. I stand in the white marble foyer, marveling at the interior: waves of whites and pinks, creams and fuchsia, gilded golden frames bullying black and white photographs, knitted pillows on cushions of gold, carved wood and glass tables, bottles of things everywhere, and across the room over a fireplace hangs a long and elegant painting in black and gold of a bare-breasted woman. I follow my host into the living room. She stops in front of the painting and stares up at the haunting face. The name “Judith” is embossed in gold over the top of the picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "302 \t“Beautiful, isn't it?” she says with a sigh, as if troubled by some sad memory. Next to the fireplace is a tall white bookcase laden with family photographs. She scans the shelves wistfully with a contaminating, vacant sadness. I stare at them; they all stare back. A large photo of a family group at a party of some sort sits in the middle of the middle shelf. “My granddaughter, Susan, and her husband,” she says sadly. With a smile that crowds out all other facial features, she points to the young girl in the photo. “And this is my great-granddaughter on her last birthday.” She beams. “Such a sweet child. Taken away so early.”\n",
      "\n",
      "303 \t“Early?”\n",
      "\n",
      "304 \t“Yes, an accident.” She wiggles a crooked finger at the young girl in the photo. “Terrible. She's with the angels now.” \n",
      "\n",
      "305 \tShe stares lovingly at the image in the photo. I imagine the two of them talking to each other in some sort of secret language. She seems so entranced that I move in for a closer look to see what all the fuss is about. Nothing special, then I notice a thin streak of silver in her hair. It starts at the little girl's forehead and flows though the length of her ponytail, which lies carelessly across her shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "306 \tThe old lady must notice me staring. She says in kind of a sleepy voice, “They say a sliver streak is a sign of rare intelligence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "307 \tShe snaps out of her trance and curtly directs me to the love seat facing the portrait.\n",
      "\n",
      "308 \t“You want anything to drink?” she asks gruffly.\n",
      "\n",
      "309 \tIs it my imagination, or does the little girl in the photo smile at me?\n",
      "\n",
      "310 \t“Well?” she snaps. \n",
      "\n",
      "311 \tI pull my eyes from the photo and dutifully take a seat. “Thank you, ma'am. A glass of milk please.”\n",
      "\n",
      "312 \tHer demeanor again shifts. “Of course,” she says with a wide smile, “and please, call me Judith.” \n",
      "\n",
      "313 \tI nod vigorously. She disappears into the kitchen, humming a haunting tune. Moments later she returns with a plate of Oreos and a glass of milk and sits next to me. She stares up at the portrait, while I eat my snack. Between cookies I take the Easter seals out of my pocket and lay them on the coffee table. I look for an opportunity to make my sales pitch, but she won't take her eyes off that damn picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "314 \t“That's me, you know, just after I killed that Persian general. Cut his head off. Oh, but it was easy.” \n",
      "\n",
      "315 \tI swallow what I have in my mouth. “Ma'am?”\n",
      "\n",
      "316 \tShe shakes her head as if waking from a dream. “Don't you know any history? What do they teach you kids in Catholic school anyway?”\n",
      "\n",
      "317 \tNot a thing about Persian generals.\n",
      "\n",
      "318 \tHer manner softens suddenly, “I'm sorry, I do get carried away at times. Yes, it's a portrait of me. You can see my name across the top in gold, can't you? But I was much younger then, so much younger.”\n",
      "\n",
      "319 \t I want to keep the conversation going so that I can somehow divert it back to my Easter seals, but she rambles on as if I weren't there.\n",
      "\n",
      "320 \t“I was a model for my Gustav. He painted it for me, my beautiful Gustav. He was a famous painter, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "321 \t“No, Mrs.—”\n",
      "\n",
      "322 \t“Mrs. Warner, but please, call me Judith.”\n",
      "\n",
      "323 \t“No, I didn't, Judith.”\n",
      "\n",
      "324 \t“Didn't what?” she snarls, changing her demeanor once again.\n",
      "\n",
      "325 \t“I, ah, didn't know he was a famous painter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "326 \t“Oh yes, quite famous.” She beams. “Gustav Klimt. They really don't teach you anything in Catholic schools, do they? I was barely a teenager, living in Vienna before the turn of the century. He was so, so manly, so bold, so full of life that he could just about burst. He taught me so much . . .”\n",
      "\n",
      "327 \tTurn of the century? I do some quick math in my head—if she was a teenager in, say, 1900, she must have been born around 1885 or so; and it's 1959 now, then she must be about . . . Judith interrupts my mental ciphering with a luminous smoke ring that travels around my neck and settles over my head like a forlorn halo.\n",
      "\n",
      "328 \t“About art, and men, and politics, and good and evil, and life . . .”\n",
      "\n",
      "329 \tSeventy-five years old, probably older. “Gee, Mrs. Warner.”\n",
      "\n",
      "330 \t“Judith, dear.”\n",
      "\n",
      "331 \t“So, Judith, is that really you?” I nudge my lonely pile of Easter seals forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "332 \tJudith abruptly turns toward me and places a bony hand on my knee. She goes on as if I hadn't asked the question. “And about love. Oh, my Gustav, you taught me so much about love. I miss you so.” Her eyes swell with tears that run down her cheeks, carrying with them a silt of black mascara. Her hand inches up my leg slowly as she talks.\n",
      "\n",
      "333 \t“You are young, so young, much younger than I was when Gustav had me. But we are never too young to learn of love, are we?” Her hand inches higher still. She places her other arm around my shoulder, trapping me there. She still holds the smoldering cigarette and an inch-long ash falls to my trousers. Judith brightens up, apologizes profusely, and tries to brush the ash away from my lap. Her hand lingers there for just a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "334 \tI look into her swollen red eyes and see a world of confusion. Judith parts her lips as if to say something, but nothing comes out, just a delicate bridge of saliva between cracked lips. Two thin streams of smoke trickle from the corners of her mouth. She notices where her hand is placed and she smiles, an embarrassed schoolgirl smile, and pulls her hand back. Then as if some connection had suddenly been broken, she sits straight up, and in a no-nonsense voice says, “So, remind me again, what is it you want? You're selling something—is that right?”\n",
      "\n",
      "335 \tMy Easter seals. I pick up one book from the pile and hand it to her. “One dollar for twenty seals.” \n",
      "\n",
      "336 \t“One dollar,” she says vacantly as if this had some special significance, and instantly her manner switches back to Gustav's Judith. With a girlish, teasing smile, she bounces off the couch. “Wait right here, my little prince,” she says, running into the next room. “I'll be right back.”\n",
      "\n",
      "337 \tI wait, and wait, five minutes, ten. From the next room, I hear Judith singing in a foreign language, German, I think, in a crusty voice that makes daring attempts to scale melodic peaks but invariably falls into a phlegmatic chasm. Still she carries on, a nightingale lost in the beauty of her own past. Finally, after almost fifteen minutes, I call out, “Mrs. Warner? Judith?”\n",
      "\n",
      "338 \t“One moment, Gustav,” she says sweetly. “I only have twenty kronen, my love. It's all I can afford. Please don't be angry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "339 \tHer gay banter confuses me, so while sitting there on her perfectly pink couch and listening to her chirping, I plan my escape. First step, stand up. Good, she's still singing.\n",
      "\n",
      "340 \t“Oh, but your Judith has been so naughty,” she says. “Please don't be angry.” \n",
      "\n",
      "341 \tI inch my way slowly toward the door when I remember the dog Elektra. The little mutt is sitting on a chair next to the door, watching me. Still I edge toward the door, one foot at a time. When I'm almost within striking distance, I realize I've left my Easter seals; not all of them, but twenty books on the coffee table.\n",
      "\n",
      "342 \t“I'm coming, Gustav. Your little angel Judith is almost ready.”\n",
      "\n",
      "343 \tDo I run back and get them? Sweat begins to roll down my brow and into my eyes, and that nasty little dog must smell my fear and starts to growl.\n",
      "\n",
      "344 \t“Here I come!”\n",
      "\n",
      "345 \tI decide to do it, dive to the coffee table, snap up the books, and bolt out of the room before that miserable pup has a chance to react; and just as my legs coil for the spring, Judith dances out of the bedroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "346 \t“There you are, my sweet.” \n",
      "\n",
      "347 \tI look up to find her running toward me, her arms outstretched as if she could gather in all the love in the cosmos. My god, how ghastly, how incredibly sad she looks in that getup—translucent nightie, red garter belt, and black nylons. Her pendulous breasts heave with every step, her face is caked with bright red rouge, green mascara, and layers of white powder, her lips hidden in a morass of crimson lipstick, her hair puffed to incredible proportions, silver with two great streaks of black running up the sides like a Bizarro-world version of the Bride of Frankenstein. She waves a crisp twenty in one hand and her pearl cigarette holder in another. I panic and dive for the door, but she catches up and grabs on to me, stuffing the twenty into my pants pocket. Her demonic dog gives chase and nips at my heel.\n",
      "\n",
      "348 \t“No, wait!” she cries, “You promised to marry me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "349 \tA flurry of arms, hands, teeth, but somehow I find the doorknob, and with a brave tug, I throw the door open.\n",
      "\n",
      "350 \t“Don't go!” \n",
      "\n",
      "351 \tShe throws her arms around me, knocking me down in the doorway. I fall flat on my face on her porch, next to the jar of spiders I left there. I grab it just as she falls on top of me and her dog on top of her. Somehow I manage to turn around, jar in hand, and flash it in front of her face. \n",
      "\n",
      "352 \tFor a moment she just stares at my monster-in-a-jar. When she finally realizes I'm holding a huge spider inches away, her face stretches out into a mask of terror and she screams—a high-pitch wailing, as if all the demons from hell were chasing her. She leaps off of me, throwing her poor dog across the porch, vaults back inside the house and slams the door. Elektra collects herself, leaps up with a threatening growl, and tears off in my direction. Like a brave gunfighter with a single bullet left, I take aim at the mutt and throw my jar of spiders. It hits the dog square on the head and shatters into a thousand pieces, scattering spiders across the porch. The beast yelps in pain, runs off the porch and out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "353 \n",
      "\n",
      "354 \tI fall asleep reliving my visit to Judith and counting my money in my head. Thirty-five dollars and only three customers. The dreams poke at me all night; no spiders, just a rush of images and sensations. Judith is there. And so is her dog, and the ghost of her creepy little great-granddaughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "355 \tI wake up suddenly, not from the dreams, but from a commotion outside—lights flashing and voices, too loud for this time of night. Leaning into my window and staring through the haze, I see several police cars and an ambulance next door at the O'Reilys. Two policemen are roughly dragging Mr. O'Reily from his porch and into one of the patrol cars; he shouts curses at the officers as they push him into the car and close the door. Moments later, two men wheel a gurney out of the house and load it into the ambulance. Banging on the windows of his cage with cuffed firsts, I hear the muffled voice of Mr. O'Reily yelling, “She had it coming . . .”\n",
      "\n",
      "356 \tI watch as the police cars and ambulance speed off into the night, the wailing sirens fading into Mrs. O'Reily's terrified voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "357 \n",
      "\n",
      "358 \tFriday afternoon. I count the minutes, the seconds until three-thirty. I prime myself for the bell, my legs ready to spring from my desk. I know what's coming, but if I can leap at just the right instant, I can delay the gruesome ordeal. I watch the second hand sweep past the nine, the ten, the eleven, the . . . but no, it stops, right there on the eleven, five seconds before the bell. I can't believe it. Sister Damian smiles and announces, in a chillingly pleasant voice, that before we leave for the weekend, it's time to award prizes for the top sellers of Easter seals. She stands at the head of the class, towering over us, list in hand. I sink lower in my seat and under my desk and, in that precarious position, listen to the names of the other twenty-four children and their paltry sales. Then the moment I dread. She announces, “And the grand prize goes to Donnie Bacon for selling,” and here she inserts a dramatic pause, “sixty books.” \n",
      "\n",
      "359 \tThe classroom exhales collective awe and wonderment; and here I go, traipsing down what seems like a three-hundred-foot aisle, to the front of the class to collect my booty: a foot-high, powder blue and gold statue of the Virgin Mary. “You're quite a little salesman,” says my teacher.\n",

      "\n",
      "361 \t“You're quite a salesman,” puffs my old man when I show him my prize. “You see, it's all about marketing.” He's on his way out to who-knows-where, but as he leaves he tells me that I am now initiated into the proud ranks of door-to-door salesmen.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "363 \tI look at my lonely Virgin sitting here on the kitchen table, her arms clasped in prayer, a golden halo over her head, her heart bared and bleeding with the loss of her son. Maxi stares at it and says, “How'd you sell sixty books?”\t\n",

Something's up—my dad never whistles. It's Frontier Day, and Annette is sitting sidesaddle on a wooden fence waving her cowgirl hat as if riding a bucking bronco and singing some goofy song about life on the prairie. Even so, it's Annette—she could be singing anything, wouldn't matter, and no one interrupts Annette.\n",

      "408 \tIt takes another five minutes to get him leashed and ready to go and ten more to get myself bundled up. We slip out the back door around 6:30 AM and set out down Union Street past Robert Morris School, across the road to the athletic field and park. Maxi and I had plotted the route across town to my grandparents' house using a map in the phone book. It works out to almost three miles along a zigzag path of back roads that looks like a maze after we traced it out. A long way in the cold—but worth the trouble. The idea is to make it look like I'm running away 'cause I'm so upset about moving but escape to my grandparents' instead. Pa will listen, and then he'll tell my dad I should stay in Batavia with him. It could work, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "409 \tA light snow is falling as I cross the park and head down Richmond Avenue. Samson, apparently immune to the bitter cold, pulls me ahead in a jerky stop-and-go motion as he has to sniff every pile of frozen dog crap on the street. It must take us another thirty minutes to work our way down Richmond to Ellicott Avenue and Street Park. The wind kicks up a notch as we enter the park—a shortcut (according to Maxi) to East Avenue. From there it's two blocks to Washington, then a quick jag north to East Avenue. The longest leg of the journey is East Avenue to Clinton; from there it's another five minutes to Grand View Terrace and my grandparents' house.\n",
      "\n",
      "410 \tWe're maybe five minutes into the park when Samson stops dead in his tracks; I nearly fall over him.\n",
      "\n",
      "411 \t“Come on, boy.” I tug his leash, but he just growls in protest. “What's the problem?”\n",
      "\n",
      "412 \tI do a quick look around to see what's bugging my dog. Through the morning haze and a light snowfall, I see a figure on the path, maybe fifty feet ahead of us. It looks like a little girl; her long black hair seems to float on the wind, and as I squint into the distance, I see she's barefoot and not wearing a coat. Samson lies at my feet, growling low like he would if there were a rival boxer nearby. “Come on, boy.” I give a few hopeful tugs on the leash while watching the figure down the path. As she disappears around the corner, Samson finally bounds up and immediately takes off, dragging me behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "413 \t“Slow down . . .” But he does exactly the opposite. In a final dash of speed, he tears the leash from my hands. “Samson . . . wait.”\n",
      "\n",
      "414 \tI sprint down the path after him until I come to the sharp bend to the left. There the path widens into a small clearing. There's a small gravestone in the center of the clearing and a woman standing nearby with a hand on the stone. I had no idea there was a cemetery in the park. Samson lies nearby, punctuating the air with staccato clouds of icy breath. I slow down to a walk and approach my dog as quietly as I can. The woman notices me when I bend down to pick up his leash. She turns toward us and drops the hood of the gray shawl she's wearing; I can see she's been weeping. She says, “She would be eight years old tomorrow,” and then turns and walks away.\n",
      "\n",
      "415 \tI pull Samson to the stone and read the inscription—Diane K. Warner, December 27, 1951–July 16, 1958. Then I remember that tomorrow is my birthday.\n",
      "\n",
      "416 \tI impulsively reach out to the stone; it topples over the moment I touch it and lands on Samson's front paw. He cries out in pain and takes off with his leash dangling behind him. It pulls me around and face-to-face with a little girl about my age and size. Her face is a mass of jagged cuts and blood; two black holes where her eyes should be stare through me. She screams, a hideous wailing sound that shakes a dusting of snow from the surrounding trees. I scream back and then take off after my dog. As I run out of the park, I can see Samson on the far side of State Street. I wave and call after him, but he takes off with his leash flying in the wind. I chase after him into the path of an oncoming car.\n",
      "\n",
      "417 \tThe car swerves and screeches to a stop, missing me by inches. A man jumps out of the front seat—it's my dad. He runs over to me and grabs me by the shoulders. “What are you doing out here? Your mother was worried sick.”\n",
      "\n",
      "418 \tI don't know what to tell him, so I say, “Samson—he took off.” \n",
      "\n",
      "419 \t“We can look for him later,” he says. “Come on, get in the car.”\n",
      "\n",
      "420 \tMy dad doesn't say a word on the slow drive home. About an hour later, a van shows up in our driveway. Three moving men have the house emptied by noon. They cram my bike into the last bit of space at the back of the truck.\n",
      "\n",
      "421 \tMy sister, my mom, and I wait for my dad in the car. It seems like the entire contents of my bedroom sits in a great trash heap between Debbie and I in the backseat. There's a knock on the rear window. \n",

      "422 \t“Goin' to Nerk?” asks Maxi.\n",

      "424 \t“Holy . . .” I think Maxi is about to say more; luckily he doesn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "425 \t“Ran away.”\n",
      "\n",

      "427 \tMy dad appears from around the back of the house to the front door. He gives it one final tug to make sure it's locked, I suppose, although it looks more like he's shaking hands with an old friend. Maxi says, “See ya.”\n",

      "428 \t“See ya,” I say and then roll up the window.\n",

      "432 Standing tall on the kneeler from my position in the back pew, and peering over the top of the bent heads in front of me, I can barely see Father McDonnell's green and gold cassock as he gives communion to the flock of anxious tongues assembled along the communion rail. An altar boy follows alongside with a gilded plate, going chin to chin to catch any stray particles. I can imagine strain under the pressure of this awesome responsibility, for if the worst were to happen and a host should fall to the floor . . . Well, Sister Petra had explained the recovery procedure.\n",
      "\n",
      "433 \t“The host must be picked up with a special linen cloth called a purificator. Because it is the body of our Savior, it is treated with the utmost reverence. A host that is dropped is handled with care by one of the sisters. She transfers the host to the purificator and then cleans the floor or carpeting underneath.”\n",
      "\n",
      "434 \tShe had journeyed into a long and mystical explanation of special cleansers that were used, and the holy water to rinse, and a hundred other steps that must be followed; and I imagined an operation more complicated than performing a tonsillectomy, which is just about the most complex thing a ten-year-old kid knows.\n",
      "\n",
      "435 \tThe usher, a tall and somber man, stops at our pew. His bald head reflects the ghostly visage of Saint Michael from the stained glass window overhead. My next door neighbor, Buddy, pokes me in the side.\n",
      "\n",
      "436 \t“Donnie, you going to communion?” \n",
      "\n",
      "437 \tMy sister and Buddy's sister, Lisa, have already climbed over us and are in the communion processional. Lisa has a tissue bobby pinned to her head as she has forgotten her hat, again, and under no circumstances are girls permitted in church without their heads covered. My folks are on their way back, shuffling down the side aisle, heads bowed and hands pointing toward heaven. \n",
      "\n",
      "438 \tBuddy leans over again, “What are you waiting for? Go on.” \n",
      "\n",
      "439 \t“What about you?” I ask. \n",
      "\n",
      "440 \tBuddy smirks, “I had a slice of toast an hour ago.” No doubt his grandmother smacked him for not fasting the required three hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "441 \tThe last pew is now on the way to the communion rail. Sister Petra passes and gives me a clerical sneer that stiffens my bow tie. Does she know I didn't go to communion? With Sister's grimace echoing in my head, I reflect on my sinful nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "442 \tThere is a picture of a soul in my catechism—a bright yellow orb that sits in the middle of your chest. When one is in a state of grace, it shines like the sun. A venial sin is a small stain, but a mortal sin, now that's a serious matter. The picture shows a massive black splotch which no doubt accounts for the owner's evil snarl.\n",
      "\n",
      "443 \tThe catalogue of sins in my third grade catechism is enormous, each one accompanied by a suitable picture. I review the list quickly in random fashion, weaving in and out of transgressions past and present—a disobedience here, a take-the-Lord's\u001e",
      "name\u001e",
      "in\u001e",
      "vain there—and come to the conclusion that I must be in a state of grace after all, in which case communion becomes not merely a convenience but a necessity and a downright pain in the ass.\n",
      "\n",
      "444 \tBy this time, the only souls at the rail are the ushers. In a panic, and much to the surprise of my parents who are sitting behind me sucking indulgences out of their own soggy bodies of Christ, I bound across the pew over Buddy's legs and down the aisle. I pick an inconspicuous spot in front of the side altar and take my place on the communion rail, my eyes anxiously darting about like a baby bird awaiting a warm worm. Yet no amount of spiritual chirping disturbs the priest, whose back is toward me, as he stashes the excess hosts in the tabernacle. I wait patiently, hoping he'll notice me.\n",
      "\n",
      "445  \tFather's arms trace a graceful path to heaven as he beckons us to prayer. “Ora te fratres,” he says, and everyone stands to receives the final blessing. A procession of three, Father McDonnell headed by the two altar boys, exits out the side door into the vestry. A final bell rings, dismissing the congregation.\n",
      "\n",
      "446 \tStill, I wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "447 \tThe church is soon deserted and dark. I wonder where my parents are and why they haven't come after me. Still I wait, by now too committed and embarrassed to leave. Hours pass. The sun sets behind the stained glass window behind the main altar, leaving it and the church black and empty. Night fades back into dawn, then night and dawn again, and still I wait. A sequence of days and nights pass, accelerating past the great rose window like the flashing lights of a police car.\n",
      "\n",
      "448 \tI have long since stopped wondering about my folks. The church is a vast cavern. A growing layer of dust settles on the statues, icons, the stations of the cross, and on me. After years of waiting, I haven't aged a day, but my clothes are starting to rot away. \n",
      "\n",
      "449 \tStill, I wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "450 \tThen a young nun appears from the vestry. She genuflects beside a kneeler at the side of the altar and begins reading from a small black prayer book. After praying silently for some time, she makes the sign of the cross, stands up, and genuflects. On her way out, she sees me patiently kneeling at the communion rail. After a quick double take, she approaches me.\n",
      "\n",
      "451 \t“Well, hello there,” she says. “I'll bet you've been here an awfully long time. Am I right?”\n",
      "\n",
      "452 \tI nod, feeling a bit embarrassed. She bends over and whispers, “What are you waiting for?” \n",
      "\n",
      "453 \t“Holy communion, Sister.”\n",
      "\n",
      "454 \t“Is that all? I wonder . . .”\n",
      "\n",
      "455 \tWhen I fail to answer, she unpins and removes the headdress of her habit and shakes her long black hair free. Pretty shocking stuff, seeing a nun's hair. It circles a pretty face set off by crisp, stern features—long, narrow eyes, thin lips, and high cheekbones, the kind of face you couldn't say no to without regretting it later. Several thin streaks of silver travel the length of her hair like shimmering comets.\n",
      "\n",
      "456 \tShe says, “I'll give you communion this time, but promise me next time you'll go up when you're supposed to. Okay?”\n",
      "\n",
      "457 \t“But, Sister,” I stammer, “I didn't think nuns could give communion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "458 \t“That rule changed ages ago,” she says with a sweet smile. “And besides, I'm not a nun yet. I'm still a postulant, sort of an angel-in-training.”\n",
      "\n",
      "459 \tI have no idea how that makes a difference, but something in her steady gaze, like she can see me from the inside, nudges me into a quiet acceptance.\n",
      "\n",
      "460 \tShe turns, approaches the altar, genuflects, and in a smooth and continuous motion opens the tabernacle and removes a golden chalice. I watch every gesture as she takes the pall from the top of the chalice and genuflects again before removing the purificator. She unfolds it, lays it to one side, and then draws a single host, which she carries to the communion rail.\n",
      "\n",
      "461 \t“Corpus Christi,” she says, holding the host at eye level.\n",
      "\n",
      "462 \t“Amen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "463 \tShe sets it on my tongue; it dissolves in an instant. “There. Now go find your folks. They must be worried sick.”\n",
      "\n",
      "464 \tI get up after centuries of kneeling and feel completely refreshed. This gives me a plucky courage, so I ask, “I've never seen you here at Saint Michael's before. Are you new to the parish or visiting?” My bravado fails in midsentence. \n",
      "\n",
      "465 \t“I'm Sister Diane Kaye,” she says, extending her hand with a small smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "466 \tAs we shake hands, her face seems to change. Trick of the light maybe? No trick. Dots of blood slowly emerge. At first it seems as if she's sprouting freckles, but they expand, and as they do, something emerges from the center of each spot. I look closer, transfixed and horrified at the same time. It looks like glass—sharp pieces of broken glass. She grips my hand tighter. I look down and see her hand is shrinking. When I look back up, she's shrunk down to about my size—a little girl swimming in an adult-sized nun's habit.\n",
      "\n",
      "467 \tThe blood rushes from my face. I try to pull away from her, but she hangs on tight and pulls me closer. Her face is swollen and bloodied from a thousand cuts of glass; her hand is a vice.\n",
      "\n",
      "468 \t“Take a good look. You did this to me,” she says. Her child's voice reeks with anger but also sounds incredibly sad.\n",
      "\n",
      "469 \tShe lets go of my hand. I scream and bolt down the aisle. As I run, I hear her shouting behind me, “No, wait. Donald, wait!”\n",
      "\n",
      "470 \tI don't know exactly why, but I stop just short of the rear doors—something in her voice, a kind of desperation. Her voice, echoing in the empty church, sounds hollow. “You don't understand,” she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "471 \tIt's like watching a horror movie. You know what's coming, something hideous and gross, and you want to look away but just can't. I don't want to turn around, but I do. Sister Diane Kaye stands at the altar with her arms outstretched.\n",
      "\n",
      "472 \t“What do you want?” I ask. I can barely hear my own voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "473 \t“I only want to help, but I don't know how.”\n",
      "\n",
      "474 \t“I don't need any help,” I shout back.\n",
      "\n",
      "475 \n",
      "\n",
      "476 \t I throw open the doors to the vestry and fly into the bright sunlight outside. My parents, sister, Buddy, and Lisa are all waiting by the front steps. \n",
      "\n",
      "477 \t“Jesus Christ, Donnie, where have you been?” my father scolds, the good will borne from his communion having apparently worn off. After the experience with my bike, I doubt my folks would buy the story of Sister Diane Kaye, so I lamely reply that I felt the need for an extra act of contrition.\n",
      "\n",
      "478 \tI don't think they buy that either.\n",
      "\n",

      "480 Leaves\n",
      "\n",
      "481 I take the long way home after school, detouring through Perkin's Park to find choice autumn leaves for a school assignment. Sister Petra had asked us all to find the prettiest, most colorful leaves and then have our moms (apparently this is beyond a dad) press them with a hot iron between sheets of wax paper, thus preserving the freshness and beauty in a paraffin glaze.\n",
      "\n",
      "482 \t“Prizes will be awarded for the most colorful and interesting leaves,” she says. “Father McDonnell will present the prizes to the winning pupils.” \n",
      "\n",
      "483 \tShe says this as if it were a strong enticement, when in fact any prize is likely to be a rosary, scapular, or statuette of the Virgin, and I need none of those things. No, I'd rather have a new bike, or the world's largest Gilbert chemistry set—the one with the Erlenmeyer flask, sixty-four chemicals (including dangerous ones like tannic acid), and an alcohol lamp. Still, it's a chance to show up Shirley Reeves, my know-it-all classmate who wins every freaking contest. She once told Sister that one can never have enough in the way of rosaries and scapulars, a line of baloney even to a ten-year-old, but I think that may have contributed to her winning streak.\n",
      "\n",
      "484 \tWalking slowly home under a cloudless autumn sky, the intense blue canvas stretches across the sky like a tight sheet. The mixture of exotic scents from curious flowers that ooze with honey and licorice buffet me as I walk through the park and make me think of the Ireland in stories my grandmother has told me—a land teeming with strange creatures and magical beings, fairies, banshee witches, spirits and sprites, and of course, the evil Black Mariah. I expect a pixie or leprechaun to jump out at me at any moment, perhaps from under that mushroom or in the crook of the old willow, but of course no such thing happens. The lack of the supernatural presents no obstacles to leaf gathering, and I soon have a killer collection of autumn's golden harvest.\n",
      "\n",
      "485 \tI arrive home with an even dozen dry leaves packed between curled pages of my fourth grade reader. The front door of my house seems stuck, but it finally gives way with an extra push, and I find myself in my living room knee deep in dried leaves. Across the room, hunched over an ironing board and surrounded by leaves of every shape, color ,and description, and rolls of wax paper, is my mother. She sees me come in but is frenetically busy steaming a pair of maple leaves between sheets of wax paper. The iron must be too hot because she struggles as if sawing hardwood with a dull butter knife. \n",

      "491 \tWithout warning, a ferocious thunderstorm erupts around us. My mom gasps with surprise, “Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, where did this come from all of sudden?” She tries to shield her leaves from the growing storm. A powerful wind blows the leaves about chaotically, rain and hail fall on the sofa, the television set, and the hutch, breaking Mom's new china. Pictures loosen from the walls and sail like poltergeist-propelled missiles, narrowly missing us. From the next room, my little brother whines loudly, his afternoon nap disturbed by the sudden inclement weather. My mother, however, remains stalwart.

I have an adolescent crush on Dream Girl—a tall, full-figured creature with shoulder-length platinum-blonde hair. Debbie hates comics, but she seems to delight in playing the role of annoying little sister and as such launches an endless stream of questions that I do my best to ignore.

      "505 \tI figure I'm safe; Debbie is always broke. She sprints up to her room and returns with a recent birthday card, from which she extracts two crisp new dollar bills. Trapped by my own incompetence, I agree to order Krazy Fun House the very next day.\n",

      "519 \tSo we traipse back into the den where my sister sits waiting patiently, clutching in her hands three envelopes of Krazy Fun House magic powder. Scott and I open one of the envelopes and pore over the instructions. I shove the other two in my pants pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "520 \t“Reads like it was written in Chinese,” says Scott.\n",
      "\n",
      "521 \t“Very perceptive, hiney-head.” But he's right. The “Made In Taiwan” label suggests that what was once eloquent Chinese had been badly translated into near English. Nevertheless, we figure out the major steps: “Locate container big enough to hold four quarts water, place Krazy Fun House at the bottom of container, add four quarts cold water (water must be cold), open envelope containing Magic Sea Creatures, use one teaspoon of Magic Sea Creatures powder, save the rest for hours of fun!”\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "529 \tHe grabs it out of my hand once again, but his grip is loose and the envelope sails through the air and lands on the heating register, the entire contents falling through the grill and into the furnace below. \n",
      "\n",
      "530 \t“Nice going,” I say, lacking a proper insult. \n",
      "\n",
      "531 \tScott slings more choice epithets, insisting that it didn't make any difference anyway as it produced no Magic Sea Creatures whatsoever. My sister has lost all interest, apparently deciding that building a snowman has more fun potential than fake sea creatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "532 \n",
      "\n",
      "533 \tDebbie doesn't last long outside. The bitter cold soon forces her inside where she joins Scott and myself huddled over the large living room heating grate. We trade dirty stories as my sister giggles and threatens to tell my mom. Scott's in the middle of a graphic description of his sixth grade religion teacher's ass when my sister emits a piercing scream. I jerk around in her direction and come face-to-face with three large, vaporous creatures that look like creations in a Max Fleisher cartoon. They swoop over us, spin around in midair, and circle back in our direction. Debbie screams again and bolts out of the room with one of the phantoms following close behind. She scurries past the living room sofa, trips over the magazine rack launching scores of Reader's Digest magazines, and finally out the front door. My mom strides into the room, no doubt armed with a severe warning, but stops dead in her parental tracks when she sees the herd of cartoon ghosts.\n",
      "\n",
      "534 \t“What in God's name is going on?” she says as the curtains suddenly come to life. They wind around her legs and start tickling her mercilessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "535 \tWe can't answer, being diverted by a pair of end tables which have suddenly sprouted wings and race about the room, chasing a hatstand and a bouncing pole lamp. The enlivened furniture carries on like drunks at New Year's as they play tag with us and one another. Scott spars with my mom's desk, fighting off paper missiles with a talking ruler. My mom screams for us to get out of the house, but I'm too occupied by circus acrobatics with galloping chairs. Both Scott and I howl with laughter. \n",
      "\n",
      "536 \t“What's the problem?” I ask my mom, but I don't think she sees the humor in the situation at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "537 \tWe hear a loud boing! as my mom snaps out of her initial shock. She fights off the animated curtains, grabs Scott and I, and drags us into a snowy street where a large crowd has gathered. Moments later, several village police cars pull up, sirens blaring. They jump out of the patrol cars but stand there frozen—in terror or amusement—at the spectacle. Our entire house has turned into some huge, animated creature—the windows massive eyes, the front door a gaping, snickering mouth. \n",
      "\n",
      "538 \tOne of the cops, the larger and more official looking of the group, pushes his way through to the front of the crowd and yells through an amplified bullhorn, “Everybody back.” \n",
      "\n",
      "539 \tSomeone from the local newspaper drives up and starts snapping photos. The whole house begins rocking to some unheard music, causing several of the spectators on the street to scream. My next-door neighbor faints. The crowd backs further away just as my dad pulls up in his yellow Caddy. He skids to a stop, jumps out of the car, and scans the crowd until he locates Scott and I. \n",
      "\n",
      "540 \t“What do you two know about this?” he shouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "541 \tWe shrug our shoulders and flash a “Who, me?” kind of look.\n",
      "\n",
      "542 \tHe mutters, “Damn shittin' kids,” and then bolts into the house, with Scott, myself, and several neighbors close behind.\n",

      "\n",
      "545 \t“I don't know exactly,” I say. “We had some of this Krazy Fun House stuff we ordered, we accidentally spilled it down the heating grate, but I don't see how . . .” \n",
      "\n",
      "546 \tMy dad flashes a look of sudden understanding. He runs across the room, avoiding a slithering throw rug, and down the basement stairs. We follow him down to the furnace and stare in disbelief—the heating pipes glow and sway like branches in a stiff breeze, cartoon flames shoot out of a grimacing cast-iron mouth, licking the rafters as the huge cylindrical body jogs in place. \n",
      "\n",
      "547 \t“Enough of this,” my dad says. He hurries over to the electrical panel and pulls the main breaker. Instantly the lights go out, and in the dim sunlight filtering down through the small windows, we watch the happy furnace slow its wild dance to a waltz before reverting to a lifeless mass of machinery.\n",
      "\n",
      "548 \tUpstairs, the house is in shambles as everything must have dropped dead in its place. The crowd outside applauds as the house has apparently returned to a more typical inanimate state. My dad surveys the damage and grumbles something about insurance and whether it covers this sort of thing. He finds the empty Krazy Fun House envelope and reads the instructions. \n",
      "\n",
      "549 \t“Says here to keep away from extreme heat. So that explains that. What do you two boneheads have to say for yourselves?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "551 \t“Sorry, Mr. Bacon.”\n",

      "\n",
      "557 \t“Now what in the hell are Beatle boots?” my father asks. I just don't get my old man sometimes. He knows what Beatle boots are. How can you not know—the whole family watched The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show just last week.\n",
      "\n",
      "558 \t“It's what the Beatles wear,” I answer lamely, at the same time holding up a target big enough to drive my old man's Caddy through.\n",
      "\n",
      "559 \tMy father takes aim and fires; he misses the bull by inches. \n",
      "\n",
      "560 \t“Beatles? Why would you want to look like them? All that long hair and noisy music. They're just a fad.” He takes a long drag off his unfiltered Pall Mall cigarette, “In a couple of months, it'll be some other group. You won't even remember The Beatles.”\n",
      "\n",
      "561 \tWhenever he says stuff like that, I'm not sure if he's serious or just trying to piss me off. He takes another drag, a sip of coffee, and returns to his morning paper. I'm not sure what to do next, so I look anxiously at my mom.\n",
      "\n",
      "562 \t“Why do you want Beatle boots?” she asks. \n",
      "\n",
      "563 \tI blurt out, “All the kids have them,” before my mind is fully engaged, and I realize that I have simply provided my dad with a scope for the verbal shotgun he has loaded, cocked, and is about to pepper us with.\n",
      "\n",
      "564 \t“And I suppose if all the kids wanted to jump off the Barge Canal Bridge you'd want to do that too?” \n",
      "\n",
      "565 \tNot that again! He shakes his head sadly at the great disappointment I must be because I want Beatle boots. “Now, I'm not going to forbid you to get these Beatle boots, son. I would hope that you have the good sense to be an individual and not follow every fad that comes along just because everyone else does.”\n",
      "\n",
      "566 \tHe closes his paper and takes the final sips of coffee before kissing my mom and I good-bye as he heads off to work. He's impeccably dressed and coifed—dark gray suit, white Oxford-cloth shirt, navy blue tie with white stripes, and shoes so shiny they wouldn't be allowed anywhere near a Catholic girls' school. In this outfit, I find it odd that he'd accuse me of mindless conformity, but I keep that thought to myself and wear it as a Purple Heart all the way to Marvin's Bootery where my new boots await.\n",
      "\n",
      "567 \tMarvin's Bootery is next to the Plaza Diner on Union Street which runs along the Barge Canal. The diner is a well-known hood hangout and sure enough, Kevin and Tim, two notorious junior high punks, are leaving with their girlfriends just as I arrive. Now I don't go much for poetry, except when forced to do so in English class. But listening to The Beatles has given me a new outlook on that particular subject. If it's cool enough for them, then why not me? I write a short verse in my head about Tim and Kevin and even imagine The Beatles singing the lyrics in a new song they introduce on the next Ed Sullivan Show.\n",

Through the store's picture window, I can see hoods and girlfriends light up cigarettes and relax as they wait for their victim to reappear. I decide to be very careful in my selection and take as much time as needed—Beatle boots are a serious matter after all.\n",
      "\n",
      "580 \tUnfortunately, Marvin has only one pair in my size, and he's in no mood for small talk. So here I am, back on the street in my new boots, and prey to the North End delinquents. I exit the store, turn right, and head down Main Street toward home. Behind me I hear the soft, syncopated echoes of steel-toed, high-heeled boots as they mimic my steps. I promise myself that I won't look back and clutch tighter the package containing my discarded Keds. The footfalls sound closer and faster, and I speed up slightly, just enough to keep ahead of Kevin and Tim. Still they stay with me, and by the time we reach the post office, they're only a few feet behind. \n",

      "\n",
      "584 \t“Yeah, a real shame.” Four voices, tittering with laughter, pulls me around as if hooks were imbedded in my flesh and I were being reeled onto shore.\n",
      "\n",
      "585 \tAt that instant, four pairs of legs stop dead, and eight eyes stare as if viewing a miracle. Kevin drops his cigarette. It fizzles in a small puddle under his feet. The girls alternately clasp hands over their faces and mouth, making small sounds somewhere between moans and screams. \t\n",

      "591 \tBest I can do, “Real funny, guys.”\n",
      "\n",
      "592 \tKevin and Tim howl with laughter. The girls taunt, “Ringo, it's Ringo!” They nearly convulse in hysterics. I smile weakly, trying to share in the joke. The mirth dies quickly, and a demonic look flashes across the faces of Kevin and Tim as they poise for the kill.\n",
      "\n",
      "593 \tI turn and bolt down Main Street, Kevin and Tim close behind and gaining. I pass St. Michael's School and dart across the street toward the church, heedless of the traffic, just ahead of an oncoming semi. As Tim and Kevin wait for the traffic to pass, I throw myself onto the church basement side door and give it a hopeful tug. It gives way with only the slightest groan in defiance. I slam it shut behind me and quickly throw the bolts, for the time being locking out those two punks. Through the door, I can hear muffled curses and threats. The sounds seem muted and distant, as if listening through padded cylinder. Gradually it subsides to an annoying hum, then fades out entirely, leaving me alone in the dark stairway leading down into St. Michael's Church basement.\n",
      "\n",
      "594 \tI take the few remaining steps down to another set of doors, hoping to circle around to the vestry upstairs and leave by the back exit. From there I can cut through yards all the way down Main Street, avoiding Tim and Kevin, until I reach the sanctuary of Scott's house. Peering cautiously through the small windows in the second set of doors, I find the basement empty except for the spiders, waiting in silence overhead on sheets of intricate silk. I look up and stare into the face of a large black spider, her massive body etched with silver streaks. She taps her web, sending a rhythmic, feral invitation. I force my mind elsewhere and venture through the doors into the basement.\n",
      "\n",
      "595 \tI fight through a suffocating darkness into the bowels of the church. Through the translucent void, I can barely discern the outline of an elevated stage surrounded by rows of chairs. This is where altar boys recite their Latin responses under the military tutelage of training acolytes. Standing there, squinting in the darkness, I can see images from my own past, reciting the Pater Noster for a smirking Father Berger. I can almost hear him casually criticizing as if I had all the significance of a lone soldier ant in a colony of billions.\n",
      "\n",
      "596  \tAs my eyes gradually adjust to the darkness, I see faint shapes on the stage and the rows of folding chairs. The basement is enveloped in a soft yet alien sound—a combination of high-pitched hissing, scraping, and turgid gurgling, like waste oozing from a sewage pipe. There is an aura of motion behind me as well, the motion of creatures I sense are utterly foreign and completely evil. I feel as if I'm interrupting some deadly ritual performed by the very lowest forms of life. The shapes ahead of me become clearer as I become accustomed to the dingy basement. There's a creature of some sort on the stage, parading about, hissing and waving its thin appendages in the air. The things in the chairs sit perfectly still, except for the occasional erratic sweep of something that looks like insect antenna. In an instant, like the snap of a rubber band, my vision clears completely; and the room is bright as daylight. That's when I realize that the room is populated by man-sized insects.\n",
      "\n",
      "597 \tAn immense scarab beetle is on stage chirping to the apparent amusement of its fellow beetles in the audience. Under the chair of each beetle is a dung ball about the size of a bowling ball. The creatures are about my height, maybe two-foot across, have shocking mandibles and towering antennas that flit about like lice on a frying pan. Their colors vary from deep crimson to metallic purple. The only thing they have in common is a white collar that chokes their stout thorax. It seems insane that a beetle would wear an altar-boy collar, but this is no stranger than the lone praying mantis decked out in clerical alb, cincture, and stole. It watches silently over the insect performing onstage, occasionally twisting its pale green head in quirky, quantum gestures.\n",
      "\n",
      "598 \tI slink to the back of the room, looking for an exit, all the while keeping a guarded eye on the praying mantis priest and his colony of beetle altar boys. The insect onstage seems agitated as it shakes its head and spastically wiggles its segmented antenna. The mantis moves out from the corner of the stage, and this excites the poor creature even more. The beetles in the audience begin chirping anxiously in anticipation; and in a lightning-flash motion, the mantis snatches the unfortunate insect in its powerful front claws, decapitates it, and begins sucking the green and red juices that spout from its thorax. I stagger back in shock and revulsion and choke back my own rising vomit. The other beetles soon join the mantis onstage and begin cannibalizing the pieces of insect left behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "599 \tThere's a door behind me somewhere that leads up into the church vestibule, so I inch back without looking behind. After two steps, my hand falls on something soft, hairy, and alive. I spin around to see a pair of black scorpions the size of large dogs, their poisonous tails poised high above me. The creatures nudge me forward with their claws, dragging rosary beads round their fat midsection. They push me closer to the mantis, who waits onstage as the beetles finish off his victim, leaving only a nauseating black smear on the stage floor. Soon I'm onstage, only feet away from certain death. I look wildly for a means of escape when I notice the icon at the end of the scorpion nun's rosary. It's an oversized crucifix of a large cockroach crucified upside down on the cross. \n",
      "\n",
      "600 \tThe startling image shocks me into a panic. I stagger back and trip over a processional crucifix among some accumulated junk onstage. It's the one we use at high mass. I say a fervent “forgive me” as I snatch the cross up in both hands and in one clean motion cleave off the head of the mantis priest. It instantly falls dead, quivering in a mass of spouting viscera that is quickly lapped up by the gluttonous beetles. I spin around and, wielding the cross like a two-handed sword, plunge it into one of the great compound eyes of the nearest scorpion. She writhes in agony and randomly stings anything within reach, including its sister. Deadly poison shoots in the air; it lands on the walls and sears the paint like acid.\n",
      "\n",
      "601 \tIn the turmoil, I flee out the front exit, down a hall, and into the altar boys' changing room. I catch my breath at a kneeler. It comes in short, erratic spurts, and my vision has suddenly shifted as if looking through a kaleidoscope. I look in the mirror above the kneeler and reel back in terror at a reflection with fleecy antenna and deep green compound eyes the size of dinner plates. Screaming in fear, I rip the mirror from the wall and toss it across the room. Through my eyes, the room is a patchwork of thousands of tiny, hexagonal images. Somehow I'm able to feel my way out of the room to a stairwell. I trip up the stairs, a journey made all the more hazardous by six legs and no arms. Eventually I bump into a door. I ram into it repeatedly until it bursts open, and I fall into the bright afternoon sunlight.\n",

      "603 \tI lay motionless trying to catch my breath. When I finally make it to my feet and brush myself off, I remember Kevin and Tim. They're nowhere to be found, but Father McDonnell rounds the corner from the rectory, and noticing me standing there with no apparent purpose, heads in my direction. \n",
      "\n",
      "604 \tThe old pastor waves cheerfully, “How are you today, Donnie?” He takes off his black biretta and mops his forehead. “You'll be late for the practice. Father Berger and the boys will be waiting for you.” \n",

      "605 \t“Practice?” I ask.\n",

      "620 \t“Sorry I'm late,” she whispers. “I had to run a little errand for Sister Theresa.” Scott and I look at each other, then at Patti. She wastes no time. “You first,” she says in a superior eighth-grade tone. \n",

You first, that's the rule.” She watches intently, biting her lower lip as I unzip my crisp uniform trousers, reach in and pull out my penis with an embarrassed languor as if I were about to take a piss in font of a live studio audience. I feel ridiculous standing there, pud in hand, as she surveys my anatomy. I catch a tell-tale glance of disappointment, yet no amount of hoping pumps any more blood into my irresponsibly limp member. After what seems like an eternity, she whispers, “Okay, now my turn.” \n",

I feel a sudden emptiness in the pit of my stomach, like I was a vast balloon that someone blew up then suddenly let go. Blood from all corners of my body rushes to my adolescent center of gravity. Her eyes dart between mine and the magic happening just south of my shiny belt with the St. Michael's School emblem. A small gasp escapes her lips—or is it the titter of laughter? I lean forward, my shaking hand inching closer to her, when the school bell signals the end of recess. In an instant, we tuck ourselves safely away. As we run down the staircase, Patti gives me a friendly kiss on the lips. “Thanks a lot,” she says with a bright smile. She runs ahead of me, across the street, into the school, and out of site.\n",

I don't know, and I don't think Sister Petra knows either; and besides, I'm not so sure that God did make me, and even if he did . . . a sudden sharp bump from under my desk, as if something was knocking from inside. A quick peek inside—only pens, ruler, crayons, a week-old lunch, and other seventh-grade sundries. I close the top and try to concentrate.\n",
      "\n",
      "630 \tWhat is sin? Before I can formulate an answer, I feel another thud from inside my desk, stronger than the first, and then another, followed by several more in rapid succession. I scan my neighbors to see if anyone is looking, but everyone is concentrating on Sister Petra's lesson. Silence for a while, until a sudden violent push from something inside my desk nearly throws me off my seat. I strain to keep the desk lid down, to keep whatever is underneath from escaping, as the thing or things inside push ever harder. \n",
      "\n",
      "631 \tWhat is venial sin? Another strong push from inside my desk. I survey cautiously around me through narrowing eyes. No one suspects a thing! I throw back the desktop. Inside, pens, papers, rulers, and crayons—all gone, replaced by a writhing mass of tentacles and eyes floating in a sea of boiling black pudding. The eyes all stare up at me out of the putrid mess. I wince as a sudden pang of pain stabs my chest, as if they are all looking directly into me, piercing my body with some alien science. There must be a thousand tentacles of various colors and sizes, all wriggling like worms on a hot plate. A gaggle of tentacles whip out and wraps around my neck and arms, trying to drag me into my desk. I let out a short cry, which is completely unheeded by Sister or any of my classmates. I attempt to cut the things free with a pair of safety scissors. They slice through the tentacles as if they were soft butter. Most retract like slurping spaghetti, but some drop to the floor, contorting wildly in apparent agony. I quickly scoop up the squirming things, leaving a nasty black smear on the floor and over my hands, shove them back inside my desk, and slam the top tight. Sister Petra and all thirty-three of my classmates look up, jolted by the sudden sound.\n",

      "638 Notes\n",
      "\n",
      "639 Scott and I would exchange notes as we passed each other in the hall between classes. It had started innocently enough as a way of swapping jokes. The innocent part didn't last long, and over time it evolved into a contest to see whose puerile imagination could produce the vilest, the most disgusting, disturbing, and obscene note. We had our own formatting standard, and one of us even wrote out the rules. First step was to fold a sheet of notebook paper in half four (if you were lazy) or five times. The idea is to create a story by unfolding. One side always started with “Other side . . .” followed by the insult of the day, usually a pair of unrelated body parts. “Penis face” was a favorite, and “testes tooth” has a nice alliterative ring to it. Sometimes we'd use anagrams. Scott came up with “avinga breath.” The fun was in revealing the revolting and bizarre content that came with each fold.\n",
      "\n",
      "640 \tIt all came to a glorious climax in late March 1965. Scott was heading to Sister Thomasine's seventh grade math class, myself to Sister Paul's eighth grade religion. I settle into my seat at the back of the class, open the Acts of the Apostles to some random page, and pretend to study while I dig Scott's latest creation out of my pocket. It starts in the usual way and continues with a picture of Scott, appropriately labeled “me”—a punk with a cigarette, boots, a scar, tattoo, and tough-guy raised eyebrows and grimace. I barely manage to stifle a laugh. Sister Paul looks around the class with laser-beam eyes. I sink into my seat, but she starts her lecture on St. Paul, her own patron saint apparently, without comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "641 \tNext fold unveils a picture of me, appropriately labeled “you”— a bizarre collection of genitals from both sexes with arrows and names of the various parts: penis lips, scrotum face, and so forth, nothing I hadn't seen before. The last fold reveals a drawing of our principal, Sister Katherine. Her breasts are the size of watermelons and take up nearly the entire page; the hem of her habit is hiked up revealing ponderous, baboon-sized genitals. Then I get to her nose—a giant dick impaled by a pair of knitting needles. So where the hell did that come from?\n",
      "\n",
      "642 \tI must have laughed out loud, because the next sound I hear is Sister Paul's rasping voice. “Mr. Bacon! Is there something you wish to share with the class?”\n",
      "\n",
      "643 \tI squeak out a lame, “No, Sister.”\n",
      "\n",
      "644 \tI try to hide the note, a conditioned response, but idiotic since all that does is make her suspicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "645 \t“Bring that up to me, Donald,” she demands.\n",
      "\n",
      "646 \tThe entire class watches as I drag my sorry ass to Sister Paul's desk, each of them no doubt thanking Jesus in their own way that it wasn't him. Sister Paul scans the front side, her left eyebrow arched high on her forehead. She turns it over and finds the picture of Sister Katherine. I swear if she were a cartoon, her eyes would pop out of her head to the sound of a loud “ah-oogah” like that wolf character in a Tex Avery cartoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "647 \tShe folds the note back up and taps it on the desk. Her old heart palpitates so fast, her scapular does somersaults on her chest. Very slowly, she hands it back to me. “Sister Katherine will be very interested in this,” she says, shooting daggers from her eyes. She calls ahead to Sister Katherine on the nun phone, a special room-to-room intercom system. She's short and has to stand on the tips of her toes to reach the receiver, which is little more than a mouthpiece extruding from the wall. There are giggles, as always, which she silences with a sinister glance. She makes a call to Scott's teacher, Sister Thomasine, as well. I know there is trouble ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "648 \n",
      "\n",
      "649 \tI meet Scott outside of Sister Katherine's office. \n",
      "\n",
      "650 \t“Nice going, jerk,” he snarls. “Had to get caught, didn't you? Touch hole!” \n",
      "\n",
      "651 \t“Bite me,” I say, feeling too miserable to think of a good comeback. I knock on the door. A pleasant voice says, “Come in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "652 \tWe do, lining up side-by-side like a pair of criminal munchkins.\n",
      "\n",
      "653 \t“Sit down, boys,” she says from behind her desk. “You have something for me, Mr. Bacon?”\n",
      "\n",
      "654 \tI hand her the note. Together we watch for telltale expressions of shock and loathing as she reads it carefully. When finished, she folds the note and sets it down. We wait as she stares through us without comment, giving us the opportunity to contemplate our fate. I sneak a glance at Scott, sitting there quivering like a pansy ass. His mom teaches fourth grade, and if Sister Katherine should call Mrs. Powell, well, the shit will hit the proverbial fan. Mrs. Powell won't snitch to my folks; she'll just chew me out. That leaves a call to the pastor, Father McDonnell. That old geezer hates kids, and especially me ever since I showed up for altar boy practice wearing Beatle boots. He'll chew me out and call my folks, who will chew me out again and probably ground me. Plus, I really don't want my mom to look at all that nasty stuff Scott drew. She still thinks we're both still sweet and innocent.\n",
      "\n",
      "655 \tBut Sister Katherine doesn't call Mrs. Powell or the pastor. She walks from behind her desk, closes and locks the door, and stands facing us. We're seated in front of her in matching office chairs covered with a cheap blonde veneer. The armrests have endured thousands of hours of students' nervous finger drumming. She hovers over us like a female praying mantis ready to mate.\n",
      "\n",
      "656 \t“You have some very strange ideas about my anatomy,” she says in a friendly, almost conversational tone. “Perhaps I can help.” \n",
      "\n",
      "657 \tWith a smile, she unfastens her veil and headdress. I've seen a nun's hair before but just once, and the sight is still shocking. She shakes her hair free and tosses the garment aside. Her hair is jet black, long and wavy with red highlights. I thought that nuns had to shave their heads after taking their vows, but apparently not as her hair is just past shoulder length. Suddenly she seems younger than I had imagined, kind of pretty too, for a nun that is. She pulls the window shade down and, without a word or warning, reaches into her habit and starts unbuttoning. We follow the trail—one button at a time. She opens the front of her habit revealing a delicate, black lace bra. I didn't think that was allowed either. She lets us stare for a few moments before unfastening her bra from the front. She tosses it aside, takes her very ample breasts in her hands, and aims them at us like a pair of missiles. Now, we're not little kids—we've seen tits before, big ones too. We found my old man's dirty magazines and had a field day. But never this close, and never in person.\n",
      "\n",
      "658 \t“Now, boys, these look perfectly normal to me,” she whispers.\n",
      "\n",
      "659 \tSuddenly I'm very aware that Sister Katherine doesn't look old at all. In fact, she looks younger than my mom, which is a creepy thought! Next, she leans against the desk facing us. We look up into her large, deep green eyes, waiting. With the grace of a dancer, she hops up on the desk, leans back, sets one foot on the arm rest of my chair and the other on Scott's chair. Slowly she raises the hem of her habit. For an instant I close my eyes, not daring to look. But as the hem passes her knees, I see smooth thighs enveloped in soft, black stockings topped by garters. She lifts a bit further, and I realize she's not wearing panties.\n",
      "\n",
      "660 \t“You see, boys,” she purrs. “Everything is quite normal under here as well.” \n",
      "\n",
      "661 \tWe sit there transfixed, unable or unwilling to look away, but it lasts only an instant. A moment later, she drops her hem, fastens her bra, and buttons her habit. As she replaces her headdress, she says, “There will be no more note passing of that nature. Right, boys?”\n",
      "\n",
      "662 \t“Yes, sister,” we parrot in idiotic harmony.\n",
      "\n",
      "663 \t“That's better. Here, Donald.” She hands the note to me. “A reminder that nuns are people too.” She opens the blinds, unlocks the door, and sends us back to class without another word. \n",
      "\n",
      "664 \tWe return in silence, unable to look at each other, or even admit that what we saw actually happened. I think maybe that Scott may tell his mom, but it's unlikely. She wouldn't believe it. No one would.\n",
      "\n",
      "665 \tWhen I return to class, Sister Paul uses the moment to offer a bit more embarrassment. \n",
      "\n",
      "666 \t“I hope you learned something today,” she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "667 \t“Yes, sister.” I nod my head, thinking I may have learned several things.\n",

      "670 The freak April snowfall is only the beginning of a massive storm front moving through upstate New York, and so I take my lonely safety-patrol position at the corner of Main Street and Chestnut, doing my best at both keeping my new Beatle boots dry and helping little kids across the snow-driven street. Scott stands nearby and provides moral support, looking forward as always to an afternoon of goofing off in general and sledding in particular. He teases the girls as they pass, all of whom threaten to tell his mom who teaches fourth grade. I tell him to knock it off. He retorts with a snappy, “Don't sweat your kidneys,” and repeats the phrase until I'm nearly insane.\n",
      "\n",
      "671 \tIn the distance, I spot Kevin and Tim approaching with their entourage. The junior high school, where the heathens attend, also let school out early due to the storm.\n",
      "\n",
      "672 \tScott says, “Don't look now, you got company.”\n",
      "\n",
      "673 \tBut we have since made an uneasy peace since our moms started hanging out together at the country club. As always, there's the nub of a cigarette dangling precariously from a thread of day-old mucus on each smirking face. They stop at my corner, and I use the situation to impress Scott with my new status as hood mascot.\n",
      "\n",
      "674 \t“How's it going guys?” I say in my coolest I-don't-give-a-shit tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "675 \tTim menacingly bounces a well-packed snowball. “Nice belt, bacon bits,” he says and laughs hysterically. Man, I hate that name. “Look at that! Jeez, Bacon, I can see you a mile away.” \n",
      "\n",
      "676 \t“Knock it off, Tim,” snarls Kevin. He gives Tim a sharp punch on the arm. “Bacon's cool, right?” \n",
      "\n",
      "677 \tTim rubs his arm and nods. “Yeah, right.” He doesn't sound convinced. \n",
      "\n",
      "678 \tThey take a moment to torment Scott, despite his lame attempt at remaining inconspicuous. He slinks quietly off in the direction of school leaving me alone with Kevin and Tim. Kevin produces a pack of Lucky Strike Filter cigarettes. He taps out and offers me one. \n",
      "\n",
      "679 \t“Have a smoke,” he says. \n",
      "\n",
      "680 \t“I better not. I'm on duty.” I try and sound official, like my entire future depends on my reputation as a school safety, even though a butt would give me something to brag about with Scott and make me look really hip in front of my friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "681 \t“Come on, don't be a dope,” whines Tim. “I thought you were cool. Kevin said you were cool.” \n",
      "\n",
      "682 \t“Say no more.” Kevin advertises his coolness with that trademark phrase. “If he says he doesn't want a smoke, then he doesn't want a smoke. So he used to be cool, that's all.” He says this all without making eye contact through several expertly-blown smoke rings. The smoke wafts past the girl standing next to Kevin (I assume she's the girlfriend). She takes off her stocking hat and shakes her long, black hair free in a dramatic move that I got to believe she's practiced at least a hundred times in a mirror.\n",
      "\n",
      "683 \t“Don't do it,” she says to me, using her hat to clear the smoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "684 \tKevin says to her, “So what are you, his guardian angel?” He and Tim laugh on cue. He taps a single cigarette from his pack. “Come on, Bacon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "685 \tFeeling guilty is a Catholic's sworn duty, so I give in. “All right, just a quick one.”\n",

      "700 \t“What is it? Come on, man, tell me.” \n",

      "\n",
      "706 \tHe leads me cautiously down the back steps to the basement level of the new school wing. We creep slowly past dark, empty classrooms. In the distance, we hear a muffled moaning. Scott raises a finger to his lips to keep me quiet. My heart jumps in my chest, loud enough to wake the saints. The door to the music room is slightly ajar, and a dim light eases through the crack casting an eerie shadow across the hallway. Scott stops as if he suddenly lost his nerve. I nudge him forward. Together we inch forward and peer through the narrow opening at a sight both monstrous and unbelievable: there, sprawled out on the floor amidst a torrent of discarded clothes and debris, two alien creatures are having sex.\n",
      "\n",
      "707 \tThe things bear no resemblance to anything human, yet somehow I have no doubt that it's Father Berger and Sister Theresa, somehow tragically transformed into other-worldly demons. The Father Berger thing has a bloated and pulsating white body, topped by a long, towering neck. The head still has Father Berger's trademark curly black hair and widening bald spot. Bandages or rags are tied across his eyes; his gaping mouth crowded with rows of jagged teeth. The thing has no limbs, only a pathetic vestigial arm that waves erratically as he thrusts into his partner. The Sister Theresa horror sits under him, moaning, trying to escape, but was held firmly in place by her long, red hair which the Berger creature holds in his salivating mouth. As he savagely thrusts into her, he pulls her by the hair, her screams muffled by a gag tied round her mouth. Her body is similar to the Berger creature's—no limbs, a long neck topped by an eyeless head. Her neck sways in apparent agony. A thick, pulsating tube like some misplaced umbilical cord joins their bodies, breaking out into a stream of hungry tendrils where it connects.\n",
      "\n",
      "708 \t“He's hurting her,” I tell Scott. “We gotta do something.” \n",
      "\n",
      "709 \t“Do what? Did you see those teeth?”\n",
      "\n",
      "710 \t“Tell your mom. She'll know what to do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "711 \tScott nods in agreement. We back away slowly when the priest-thing somehow detects us. It tosses aside Sister Theresa by her hair and hisses at us, baring rows of sharp fangs. \n",
      "\n",
      "712 \tScott and I take off in different directions down the hallway—Scott toward the front of the building and his mother's classroom, myself toward the back of the building. I find an unexpected stairway leading to another deserted and dark hallway. I try the doors at the far end, knowing that the creature is close behind, but they're locked. I pull frantically at the door when I hear Father Berger's soothing voice behind me.\n",
      "\n",
      "713 \t“The boiler room is off-limits to students,” he says in an even voice. I turn around and face the priest. He appears completely normal, except for a loosened collar which he fastens while talking. “Maybe, if you're a good boy, I could give you a little tour. Would you like that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "714 \t“No thanks, Father. I gotta get going.”\n",
      "\n",
      "715 \t“It's no trouble. Something special for my favorite altar boys. He pulls a key ring from his pocket and unlocks the door. “You are one of my favorites, aren't you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "716 \tI start to edge away; he grabs my arm and pulls me closer.\n",
      "\n",
      "717 \t“What did you see just then?” he asks calmly. \n",
      "\n",
      "718 \t“See? What do you mean, Father?”\n",
      "\n",
      "719 \tHe shakes his head. “ You know exactly what I mean. What did you see?”\n",
      "\n",
      "720  \t“We didn't see nothin'.”\n",
      "\n",
      "721 \t“Good answer, Mr. Bacon, good answer. You just remember that. Whatever it was you thought you saw wasn't really there. Understand? No one would believe you or your juvenile delinquent friend anyway.”\n",
      "\n",
      "722 \t“What were you doing to Sister Theresa?” The words stick in my throat. My heart pounds a thin line of sweat across my forehead. He watches me, like a wild dog sensing my fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "723 \tHe presses closer and whispers as if saying a prayer, “I know what you're thinking, but it wasn't my fault. She tempted me, every day, inviting me with her eyes, her body, until finally I couldn't resist. She didn't want me to resist!” He raises his voice suddenly and clamps a clammy palm over my mouth. “She wanted it, you know. She tempted me. All of you tempt me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "724 \tIn an instant, he clasps his hand over my mouth and pushes open the boiler room door. I struggle to free myself, try to yell out, but he grips me tighter. “Just relax,” he says. “No one will hear a thing down here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "725 \tHe drags me one step at a time down into the bowls of the boiler room. I try kicking and screaming. This seems to amuse him more than anything, as if he were taunting a small pet. When we reach the bottom of the stairs, he drags me between the two boilers. Sweat pours off of me in the searing heat. Even in the dark I can see his mad grin and shining eyes. I squirm like a greased pig and manage a firm kick to his balls. The grin disappears. He slams me up against the large boiler tank and presses his sweaty body against mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "726 \t“Stay still, you little bastard.” \n",
      "\n",
      "727 \tI feel his hot breath against my face and an eager hand inch up my leg. His mad eyes stare into mine, and my only thought is—I'm going to die.\n",

      "728 \tSuddenly the room blazes with light. A booming voice says, “That's enough, Father Berger. Let go of the boy.” \n",

      "730 \tAt first his grip tightens, then Father Berger takes my face in his hand and gently pushes my chin up. He whispers something to me that I still don't understand, “A saint is nothing more than a sinner wearing suspenders.”\n",

Through wet, hazy eyes, I try to squirt on a dollop of toothpaste, but the damn brush seems too small for my hands. I give up and toss it aside. Still sleepy—I run some cool water and splash a couple of handfuls over my face and head.\n",
      "\n",
      "738 \tThat's when I realize my hair's gone—cut down to a quarter inch.\n",
      "\n",
      "739 \tI rub the sleep from my eyes and stare into the mirror. The scowling face, pouting jowls, and a military haircut look vaguely familiar, but certainly not like me. A moment later, another face pops up behind me. Grinning and dominated by oversized sunglasses, I don't recognize this face either, but it seems to know me well enough as it greets me with a chummy, “Hey, man!” The face is attached to an emaciated body consumed in a striped sport coat and neon green pants. I have this sudden, overwhelming urge to throw the guy against the wall, but settle instead for some high-class cursing.\n",
      "\n",
      "740 \t“What the hell is going on here? Who the hell are you, and whatta ya doin' in my bathroom?” The words spew out as if my mouth had a mind of its own, and I think that not only do I not look like me, I don't sound much like me either.\n",
      "\n",
      "741 \tAfter a noisy argument, I realize that this weird, skinny guy calls himself Slick and is apparently my manager. I wasn't aware that a high school wrestler needed a manager.\n",
      "\n",
      "742 \tMy dad yells from downstairs that breakfast is ready. Now what goes through my head is something like, “I'm not feeling well. Maybe I should stay home from school.” But when I throw open the bathroom door and shout downstairs, what actually comes out is, “Hey! Listen up! No one tells the Magnificent Murdo what to do. No One! You got a problem with that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "743 \tThe last line sounds more like, “yoouse gotta problem wid dat?”\n",
      "\n",
      "744 \tI can't believe I just yelled at my dad. No reply—I guess he doesn't believe it either. That or he's giving me time to pray before he kills me.\n",
      "\n",
      "745 \tI head back to my bedroom. Slick watches me dress for school like an overprotective big brother. He follows me downstairs to the kitchen where we elbow into place at the breakfast table. My sister Debbie, and Chris and Pat, my two kid brothers, are already there, alternately playing with and eating bacon and scrambled eggs. No one expresses any surprise whatsoever at my appearance or the presence of my companion. Indeed, my mom has two places set for us, and my dad hands Slick the sports section of the morning paper like it's an everyday occurrence. Then he turns to me and says, “So, the Magnificent Murdo graces us with his presence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "746 \tMy mom, who seems a bit edgy herself, says, “Don't get him all upset before the big meet tonight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "747 \tIn idiotic unison, my brothers open their mouths, revealing a noxious amalgam of bacon, eggs, toast, and maple syrup.\n",
      "\n",
      "748 \t“Knock it off, you two,” I shout at them.\n",
      "\n",
      "749 \tThey ignore me and giggle at one another. \n",
      "\n",
      "750 \tMy sister says, “What's the matter, Donnie? Nervous?”\n",
      "\n",
      "751 \tThat's when I remember that my high school wrestling team has the final match of the season tonight against the Lyons Lions for the county championship.\n",
      "\n",
      "752 \tLoud, funny words fly out of my mouth as if I'd rehearsed the whole speech. “Listen up! My name is the Magnificent Murdo! You got that? Magnificent Murdo! The Magnificent Murdo is never nervous. The Magnificent Murdo is mad! He is sore!” I pick up a nearby glass of orange juice and slam it on the table. My folks glare at one another, then at Slick.\n",
      "\n",
      "753 \t“Hey, baby, it's cool,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "754 \tMy dad goes back to his paper without commenting, and we finish breakfast in a strained silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "755 \n",
      "\n",
      "756 \tScott arrives to pick me up for school; I can hear his phlegmatic '65 Dodge special a quarter mile away. With a barely human grunt, I grab my books and lumber out to meet him, followed as always by Slick. We pile into the backseat without a word of greeting. Scott stares at us in the rearview mirror. “Don? You feeling okay?” \n",
      "\n",
      "757 \tI'm thinking, of course I'm okay, what else would I be? But what comes out is, “Forget that Don crap and listen up. I'm the Magnificent Murdo. Understand?” Scott mumbles something that sounds vaguely like “asshole” and shakes his head; he drives extra slow to school.\n",
      "\n",
      "758 \tI go through the day watching the other kids avoid me. The Slickster and I eat lunch at an isolated table in the corner of the cafeteria. I take study hour alone at the library. My girlfriend screams and runs away the instant she sees me. All the girls scream; all the guys walk in the opposite direction. Banners all over school advertise tonight's wrestling match with the Lyons Lions. In my locker, I find a note scribbled in black crayon from “a friend” telling me that “you better win, or else!” \n",
      "\n",
      "759 \tOr else what? Infuriated, I slam the locker door, knocking it off the hinge.\n",
      "\n",
      "760 \tAs I stand there listening to the sound my own heavy breathing, a growling laugh echoes over the PA system. I turn around to find the once crowded hallway is now vacant and dim. Vapors rise from the ground; a sallow light permeates the suddenly chilled air. An alien form appears at the end of the hall. Dim at first, then a sudden blinding light reveals a massive silhouette. The figure stretches and growls as if breaking out of chains. Slowly he emerges from light. Blood oozes from his forehead forming a black puddle at his feet. Through the haze, I recognize my opponent in tonight's match, Rick “Turk” Tricarico, a Lyons senior known on the high school wrestling circuit as the Executioner.\n",
      "\n",
      "761 \t I yell down the hall, “Executioner! What the hell are you doing here? This is Newark Reds' country.” \n",
      "\n",
      "762 \tThe “Reds” team name comes from our school colors—maroon and gray. Not as clever as the “Lyons Lions,” but anything's better than the “Newark Maroons.”\n",
      "\n",
      "763 \tTurk raises his arms and shouts back, “You're dead meat, Murdo! You hear me? Dead. Meat!”\n",
      "\n",
      "764 \t“Over my bleeding, dead carcass, Executioner!” \n",
      "\n",
      "765 \tHe turns and vanishes down the hallway.\n",
      "\n",
      "766 \n",
      "\n",
      "767 \n",
      "\n",
      "768 \tWe arrive early that evening for the county championships at the Rochester War Memorial. My parents, Scott and his mom, and my brothers and sister sit together on the Newark side of the packed arena. On the opposite side, the Lyons students cheer in matched frenzy. They wave banners with the slogan, “Kill 'em, Executioner.” The Newark fans scream back and wave banners with my own catch phrase: “Listen Up! Go, Murdo!” \n",
      "\n",
      "769 \tIn the locker room, Slick directs my preparation—layers of black and red makeup, streamers wrapped around my arms and legs, day-glow ear protectors, and surreal sunglasses complete my bellicose outfit. I feel ridiculous and proud at the same time. The Slickster encourages me with “Go, baby” as my theme music (the opening measures of Straus's Thus Spoke Zarathustra) announces my entry into the ring.\n",
      "\n",
      "770  \tThousands of screaming fans greet me as my manager escorts me from the locker room into the ring. My mom waves, and my dad flips a thumbs-up sign; my brothers both stick their tongues out. The music stops, and the Executioner's music, Chopin's Funeral March, blares to the screams on the Lyons side of the gym. Over the PA system, the ring announcer's voice echoes, “Now entering the arena . . . .” The Lyons side goes mad with screams of “Dead man!” \n",
      "\n",
      "771 \tThe Executioner is dressed entirely in black. His face is hidden behind a black leather mask and wide-brimmed hat; his black wrestling boots extend past his knees. Accompanying the Executioner is his manager, a savage girl dressed in a black mourning dress, tiara, and veil. She wields an evil sickle like Death and shakes her waist-length black hair, streaked with red flashes, in spasmodic, insane fits as if shaking loose a nest of snakes. The Newark side boos and hisses, but under the layers of tacky makeup and badly colored hair, I recognize my ex, and the Executioner's current girlfriend, Sophie Provenzano.\n",
      "\n",
      "772 \tI grab Slick, who is bouncing around like a toy poodle on speed behind me, by the collar and yank him within an inch of my face. “Oh man, you gotta be freakin' kidding!” We had dated briefly for a couple of months. Technically, you could say I dumped her because she was a bitch, although the way she tells it, I was a complete asshole. I think we were both right.\n",
      "\n",
      "773 \t“Be cool, baby!” All of Slick's responses are variations on the same theme, and all are equally unhelpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "774 \t“No, man, you be cool and listen up. A month ago that creature was my girlfriend.”\n",
      "\n",
      "775 \t“Baby, you dated a Lyons chick?” He nearly doubles over with laughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "776 \t“Yeah—a freakin' nut job. Real pissed when I broke up with her.” Slick is laughing too hard to comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "777 \tThe ring announcer continues his animated introduction as Turk climbs into the ring with the help of his manager who thoughtfully parts the ropes for him. “Now entering the ring, from parts unknown, weighing in at one hundred twenty pounds, the 1967 state champion in the one-hundred-twenty-eight-pound weight class, Rick ‘Turk' Tricarico,” he delays for effect. “The Executioner!”\n",
      "\n",
      "778 \tA chorus of jeers from the Newark side meets a wave of cheers from the Lyons fans.\n",
      "\n",
      "779 \t“And his opponent. From Newark High School, weighing in at one hundred and nineteen pounds. Undefeated at home, three-time varsity letterman, and 1967 state champion in the one-hundred-and-twenty-pound weight class, Don Bacon . . . The Magnificent Murdo.” He stretches out my ring name, adding the appropriate fall in pitch, so that it sounds something like this: “Murrrrrrrrrdooooooooo!” Cheers and curses switch sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "780 \tI look to my manager for some encouragement. “Turk's dropped a weight class. Any bright ideas, smart ass?” \n",
      "\n",
      "781 \t“No sweat! He's messed up big time from trying to make weight. Now listen, baby, we're tied with Lyons at five matches each. This is the tiebreaker. Don't let us down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "782 \tThere are banners and local TV cameras, mad, screaming fans, and blistering lights on my back. The referee blows the whistle for the first period. I run out into the center circle, but before I can react, a pair of fists come down hard on my head, sending me sprawling to the ground. I roll to safety, spring to my feet, and dive for the Executioner's legs. He jumps back, but not quick enough, and I flip him over for the takedown. The referee holds two fingers in the air; the crowd goes wild.\n",
      "\n",
      "783 \tAfter two periods, the Executioner leads by one point, a difference of one reversal. As the Slickster sprays a stream of water into my mouth, I glance over to the opposite corner where Sophie, Turk, and the Lyons coach seem to be in a heated argument. All I can catch over the crowd noise is Sophie yelling, “Do it or else, Turk!” and the Lyons coach screaming, “No way, Rick, no way!” Sophie flips me off as the whistle sounds announcing the start of the third and final period.\n",
      "\n",
      "784 \tWe both run to the center of the mat and circle each other like a pair of starving hyenas. I make a dive for the takedown, but instead of the standard drop back, the Executioner jumps onto my back and starts pounding me like I were a piece of meat. He springs to his feet and follows up with a flurry of kicks to my groin, more fists on my back, and a kick or two to the side of my head. Caught off guard by Turk's sudden disregard for high school wrestling rules, the referee runs around us, blowing his whistle like a maniac while trying to hold off the two coaches who have jumped into the ring trying to pull Turk off of me. They manage to drag him over to his corner. As I stagger to my knees, Sophie Provenzano suddenly jumps into the ring and starts kicking me in the stomach.\n",
      "\n",
      "785 \t“You bastard!” she screams with a well-placed kick. “You fucking bastard! Asshole! No one breaks up with me. No one!”\n",
      "\n",
      "786 \tI hear a snap from inside my own chest as Sophie kicks in a rib. A pair of referees and my coach pull her off me, but not before a well-placed kick to the head nearly knocks me out cold. Still screaming as they drag her away, she breaks loose and attacks the Lyons coach in a blur of kicks and punches. He falls to the mat and rolls around, screaming and clutching his leg in agony. In the ensuing chaos, Turk breaks free and attacks me with his manager's sickle.\n",
      "\n",
      "787 \t I can't fight this way. I'm thinking takedowns and reversals, and this maniac is beating me over the head with a fucking stick! A steam of blood trickles into my left eye; my head and side pound in pain. I try to stand up, but the Executioner clotheslines me back onto the mat. He follows up with a series of illegal moves from professional wrestling: atomic knee drop, a double ax handle, and a suplex. Realizing I'm too beaten up to fight back, Turk easily scoops me up like a rummage-sale doll and slams me down face up on the canvas. He makes the cover and counts me out himself as the referee is preoccupied with Sophie who has started to attack the Newark Coach. A stream of people, teachers, and a couple of cops finally pull Turk, who is still counting me out, off of me. I roll over just in time to see them drag Turk and Sophie from the gym.\n",
      "\n",
      "788 \tThe Slickster helps me to my feet. I'm able to stand just long enough to be declared the winner by disqualification. A huge cheer circles the Newark side of the gym. I have just enough energy to wave to the crowd before my vision goes black, and I pass out.\n",
      "\n",
      "789 \n",
      "\n",
      "790 \tSometime later, lying flat on my back, I open my eyes to find a crowd of faces above me—my father, Slick, my coach, and Scott. They all look anxious, but no one says a word for a long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "791 \tScott breaks the spell. “Hey, Don. You okay?”\n",
      "\n",
      "792 \tBest I can do is gurgle a bit and nod. Scott says to my dad, “He'll live.”\n",
      "\n",
      "793 \tMy dad bends down for a closer look. “Quite a cut you got there, son.” That's when I notice the wetness on the left side of my face. Turk must have sliced my face up with his manager's sickle.\n",
      "\n",
      "794 \tThe coach motions for a medical team; they lay a stretcher next to me. “Easy does it,” my coach says. “You put on quite a show.”\n",
      "\n",
      "795 \tMy dad says, “But it was too close. You damn near lost it for us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "796 \tThe pounding in my head blocks any attempt at speech. I close my eyes and feel a hot rivulet of blood flow down my cheek and onto the mat.\n",
      "\n",
      "797 This story is dedicated to the memory of Rick “Turk” Tricarico.\n",
      "\n",
      "798 \n",
      "\n",
      "799 Love\n",
      "\n",
      "800 I wake up.\n",
      "\n",
      "801 \tThe light streaming in through the windows of my bedroom is brighter than expected, and I swear under my breath thinking that I must have overslept. I jump down from the top bunk and survey my bedroom. Something doesn't feel right; the room is absolutely spotless—neat in a way that suggests someone had a cleaning frenzy during the night. And my brothers are missing, as are the usual sibling droppings of underpants, shoes, and toys. Stranger still is the time on the alarm clock reads exactly 5:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "802 \tWell, at least I'll make it to work on time. In the bathroom, I go through the usual morning ritual—brush my teeth and run a razor over my face. Both are completely unnecessary. My part-time job is foreman on the French bean-canning line, and who the hell cares?\n",
      "\n",
      "803 \tI throw open the blinds, expecting to see the forested hill behind our house, but find instead the window is overgrown with thick vines—some type of ivy, the same kind that grows around the rocks in the backyard patio. I strain to push the vines away from the window so I can get a look outside, but they're grown in too thick. Beyond the vines, there is only a blinding light. I examine the other upstairs windows but find they are all overgrown with the same thick ivy.\n",
      "\n",
      "804 \tA shiver of panic as I call downstairs, “Mom, what the hell's going on?”\n",
      "\n",
      "805 \tNo answer; my words echo through an apparently empty house. Downstairs I find more of the same at every window and door, and I come to the conclusion that our house has somehow become engulfed in a sea of hostile plant life. I pick up the phone to call for help, but the line is dead, not even a dial tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "806 \tI decide that the sensible thing to do is to somehow chop my way out, make it to a neighbor's house, and call the police or whatever village department is responsible for this sort of emergency. A quick search for tools in the basements turns a small keyhole saw. Lucky because my dad doesn't get tools, and a keyhole saw is quite a specialized instrument. Weapon in hand, I run back upstairs and throw open the front door. The way is blocked by thick, lush vines. I start sawing.\n",
      "\n",
      "807 \tSometime later, I've created an opening some three feet deep and large enough to walk into. It occurs to me that the wall of vines may be too deep to penetrate with a puny keyhole saw, but take some reassurance that the light through the vines seems brighter. \n",
      "\n",
      "808 \tHours later I finally break through the last wall of vines. Looking back through the tunnel of plants is my front door, now fifty or more feet away; straight ahead the light is brilliant, although there is no sun overhead. I look down to find nothing below; my house seems to be supported by a column of thriving ivy stretching to infinity in either direction. I mumble a sincere, “Oh, shit, now what?” when the phone rings.\n",
      "\n",
      "809 \tI run through the tunnel of vines thinking phone service must have been miraculously restored, and I'm not alone in this nightmare after all. I grab the receiver on the fourth ring and pant a labored, “Hello.”\n",
      "\n",
      "810 \t“Don? Where are you, man?” It's Scott—he'll know what's going on.\n",
      "\n",
      "811 \t“Scott, you're not going to believe this . . .” I start to explain, but he interrupts me. \n",
      "\n",
      "812 \t“Believe what? You were supposed to be here an hour ago. We're all waiting for you.” \n",
      "\n",
      "813 \t“Waiting for what?”\n",
      "\n",
      "814 \t“For what? For Euchre. Dave and Eileen are here, the pizza's been ordered, but you ain't here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "815 \tI have no recollection whatsoever about any Euchre game. Dave and Eileen—who the hell are they? I have this momentary brain fart, as if I'm not really here at all but rather some character in a bizarre story.\n",
      "\n",
      "816 \t“Don, you there?” Scott says in one of his trademark silly voices. It snaps me back to the present. Eileen is Scott's sister; Dave Bloom, his bother-in-law. Somehow remembering gives me some reassurance. So what do I tell Scott?\n",
      "\n",
      "817 \t“The house has gone mad,” I yell into the phone. The answering silence is terrifying. A thought cloud forms overhead; and I see Scott looking into the receiver, puzzled as ever, his pliant face distorting into exaggerated grimaces, his expressive right eyebrow arched high over his head like a misplaced fermata.\n",
      "\n",
      "818 \t“What are you talking about?” he finally says.\n",
      "\n",
      "819 \t“Scott, just come over here, please. You won't believe it.” \t\n",
      "\n",
      "820 \tBefore he can answer, there's a sinister click as the line goes dead. Through the door, through the tunnel of vines, I hear a sharp noise and the rush of a giant wind. I throw the phone down and run to the front door. The tunnel of vines is on fire, burning horrifically. A blast of hot air and demonic flames flash through my front door into my living room, spreading from the drapes, across the wall, and into the ceiling. I turn to run when the phone threatens with a clangorous ring.\n",
      "\n",
      "821 \n",
      "\n",
      "822 \tThen I wake up.\n",
      "\n",
      "823 \tI lift my head in a daze and glance in the general direction of the clock sitting on my dresser across the room. The luminous hands stretch across roman numerals, and squinting from my top bunk, I see it's early in the morning, still dark, 5:00 AM. The alarm would have gone off anyway, so I jump out of bed, narrowly missing my brothers who are alternating snores and whistles from the bottom bunk and the single bed next to us. Every time I do this, I silently curse my sister for having the luxury of her own bedroom—no brothers who grit their teeth, fart, giggle, or put a damper on my love life. I feel my way out of the cramped bedroom into the hall, grab my hard hat, and pick up the phone; a dull “hello” barely escapes the tacky saliva bridge between my lips. \n",
      "\n",
      "824 \tA familiar voice replies, singing to a familiar cartoon melody. I want to laugh and scream at the same time, “Scott! Are you crazy, man? It's five in the morning.” \n",
      "\n",
      "825 \t“Isn't that some . . . thing,” he says and then hangs up.\n",
      "\n",
      "826 \tNow I think I've gone crazy, but I remember today's my birthday, and this must be Scott's wise-ass way of reminding me.\n",
      "\n",
      "827 \tMy mom shouts from downstairs. “Who was on the phone?” \n",
      "\n",
      "828 \t“Just Scott being his usual self.” \n",
      "\n",
      "829 \tApparently this is explanation enough for my mom, and she retires with a “that Scott” trailing in the distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "830 \tI pick up the phone and dial his number. “I'll fix his sorry ass.”\n",
      "\n",
      "831 \tAn old woman answers after five rings, “Yeah.” I recognize Scott's mom, but she sounds ancient or ill.\n",
      "\n",
      "832 \t“Is Scotty there?” I ask carefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "833 \tA pause then, “Scott? Who is this?” \n",
      "\n",
      "834 \t“It's Don. Don Bacon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "835 \t“Don Bacon? Is this some kind of sick joke?”\n",
      "\n",
      "836 \tI don't know what to say. “Sorry, I must have dialed the wrong number.”\n",
      "\n",
      "837 \tThere is an unnatural pause; the receiver suddenly feels like a weapon about to explode. \n",
      "\n",
      "838 \t“Look, whoever you are, Scott and Don are dead.” She sounds sad, even hopeless. “They died on Don's birthday in a car accident a year ago today.” Her voice chokes with rage. “How dare you call at a time like this? You're sick! Do you hear me? Sick!”\n",
      "\n",
      "839 \tI draw back in terror, drop the receiver, and run downstairs to the kitchen. My mother is standing at the stove making breakfast with her back facing me.\n",
      "\n",
      "840 \t“Better hurry up, dear. You'll be late for work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "841 \tSomething in her voice triggers a wave of nameless fear. I grab her by the shoulders and turn her slowly around. She resists at first but suddenly spins around. The move catches me off guard. I stumble backward and fall. \n",
      "\n",
      "842 \tHovering over me, grinning like a madman, is Scott wearing a wig and dressed in a woman's blood-splattered nightclothes. He's the color of death, his face splattered in crusted blood. Deep cuts run down either side of his face, each leaking some black, vile fluid. One eye is missing, the other hangs by a greasy thread on his cheek. It dangles over me for a moment, snaps off, and lands on my chest. Then like some wounded cockroach, it starts crawling toward my face.\n",
      "\n",
      "843 \tHe screams at me, waving a spatula over his head like a weapon. “Watch for the car!”\n",
      "\n",
      "844 \tI open my mouth in terror, trying to scream but nothing comes out. The crawling eye inches up my throat, hops onto my chin, jumps up suddenly, and lands in my mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "845 \n",
      "\n",
      "846 \tThen I wake up . . . lying on a cushion of grass on a high hill. The setting sun sends beams of light through delicate clouds. The nightmare has left me in a daze, still shaking. I sit up in a panic and look around for Kathy. I find her in the distance, standing at the top of the hill with her back toward me. Her short blonde hair and denim skirt sway in the cool twilight breeze. As the dream fades, I remember why we're here.\n",
      "\n",

      "1013 What I have in common with Alice (of Wonderland fame) is this—we both give ourselves very good advice but very rarely take it. Take women for instance. Despite practical self-advice to the contrary, I fall in love with every woman I meet. It started with Kathy Stevens, the gorgeous redhead who lived behind my grandparents in Batavia. I doomed that budding relationship when I zapped into her family's TV set. Then there was Patti Collins, a blonde cutie a grade ahead of me and a foot taller. She had these silky legs that went all the way up to a most perfect ass. Even a seventh grader knows a perfect ass when he sees one. She knew I knew, so when she invited me up to the choir loft, how could I refuse? And then there was Paula, and Carleen, and Karen, and Sophie and Cheryl, then another Karen, and then Tina, and Deb, and Jeanie, and . . . the list goes on. Nancy came around somewhere around the tail end of 1970—a blind date set up by Scott—and I fell in love with her too.\n",

      "1015 \tMaybe I'm that idiotic after all, because I'm twenty-something and getting married, and I don't even rate an opinion in the whole wedding-planning deal. Nancy and her mom do all that.

It's a Catholic wedding, and I don't feel the need to expound on that particular subject.\n",

I had heard somewhere that the first years of marriage can spawn ludicrous arguments. We had reached our fifth anniversary without killing each other, so I thought we were in the clear. Apparently not, and after an hour of screaming at each other, I storm out of the apartment. I drive around town for while and eventually end up in some neighborhood bar where I get three vodka and tonics' worth of bad advice from polyester losers and sympathetic locals.\n",

      "1017 \tI hook up with some guy named Mitch, or rather, some guy named Mitch hooks onto me. His wiry frame is smothered in baggy dungarees and an old army jacket about three sizes too large. He wears this constant smart-ass smirk on his face, and opaque wraparound sunglasses that he never takes off. After much cajoling, he convinces me that I need some action. To Mitch, that means the only strip club in Webster, the Naughty Pussycat. \n",

Please give a huge Naughty Pussycat welcome to . . . Lynette!” \n",
      "\n",
      "1030 \tA spotlight falls on a strikingly attractive young woman with flowing red hair. She writhes passionately but professionally to the curious rhythms of Maurice Ravel's Aborado del Gracioso. It strikes me as an odd choice, yet her pulsating body punctuates the music's Spanish flavor, adding spice like a fine Hungarian paprika over eggs benedict. She tours the stage, dancing over every man as each stare at her breasts before stuffing a dollar bill into a hungry G-string. Lynette visits our end of the stage, teasing each of us in turn. Mitch offers up a crisp dollar bill that is quickly snapped into place. His friend sits motionless, simply staring up at her writhing form. As she hovers over me, she twirls a string of imitation pearls in her fingers and runs the length of beads over her lips, her wet tongue darting out like a snake's to lick the occasional passing bead. The effect gives me an immense boner and for the moment forces Nancy from my mind completely. At the same time, it seems to me that Lynette is completely out of place here. We make eye contact, for just an instant. Mitch looks over and flashes a greasy grin. But the subliminal message I get from Lynette is anything but sexy. It says, “Leave now!”\n",
      "\n",
      "1031 \tThe music changes. At the same time, a loud ruckus as someone throws the front doors open, abruptly breaking our connection. Lynette hurries to the other side of the stage, and I look askance at Mitch thinking that this is some sort of raid and he's responsible. Mitch glares into the darkness toward the door, watching a large group as they invade the bar like bikers on acid. “Oh, Christ, not again,” he curses.\n",
      "\n",
      "1032 \tThey are fashionably dressed in clerical black. Each wears a brown paper sack over his head, which is secured by a starched white collar. Each bag is painted with a different face, but invariably they are all sad. Some have great tears drawn in a childish scrawl. They behave like drunk college kids after a pep rally, running around the stage, hooting and howling, jumping on the furniture. The regular patrons and Lynette ignore them as if they were disobedient children. \n",
      "\n",
      "1033 \t“Who the hell are they?” I ask Mitch. He only shakes his head, but our poet-waitress who is eternally hovering nearby tells me it's the Rochester chapter of Priests Anonymous on their monthly crawl through the local strip clubs. She bends over and whispers softly, “I'd be leaving if I was you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "1034 \tBefore I can comment, one of the bagged priests grabs me by the arms, pulls me onto the stage, and yanks my trousers down to my ankles. The anonymous priests all cheer in unison, throwing beer at one another and anyone else nearby. Lynette seizes the opportunity to throw her arms around me and grind her pelvis into my groin. I automatically grind in response, but she pushes me away with a discreet whisper, “Go now!” I loose my balance and fall flat on my back where I am immediately pelted by a sack-headed army of clerics with beer, mixed drinks, and assorted bar munchies.\n",
      "\n",
      "1035 \tThe lights, music, booze, and bodies swirl in a hurricane of cacophony. I manage to crawl from beneath the flood of bodies, off the stage onto the floor where I pull up my pants and make a dash for the men's room. I pull the door closed behind me and stand in front of it, pissed off and panting like an animal. Bottles and glass explode against the door behind me.\n",
      "\n",
      "1036 \tSomeone gives the door a slight push, and I stand aside. One of the priests enters, walking sidesaddle and carrying a long-necked bottle of Genesee Cream Ale. He weaves past me, cozies up to the urinal, sets his beer down on top, unzips his fly, and pulls out the most monstrous penis I have ever seen. I can't help but stare as it is easily a foot long and wide as a kielbasa.\n",
      "\n",
      "1037 \t“Take a picture, fella, it'll last longer.” He laughs at his own puerile humor, pulls the bag off his head, and wedges it in the urinal plumbing. I do my best to finish up; my only thought at this point is to get the hell out of Dodge. Weaving as he shakes off trailing drops, the priest leans over to me and says, “We ain't really priests, you know?” His breath reeks of smoke, beer, and makes the hair on my toes curl. I nod enthusiastically but stare straight ahead. He casually stuffs his hulking member back into his pants, reaches out for his bag but misses. \n",

A thought crosses Peter's mind and spreads through the bar. It gently rocks the happy-hour crowd like a light breeze over a wheat field. A blonde woman wearing nothing but blue spiked heels stretches out on a satin couch; a snake slinks slowly around her neck and between her breasts. She's reading Kafka through winged sunglasses studded with jewels. \n",

He dives over the bar, does a summersault in midflight, and lands at the foot of the pedestal.\n",

Very Kafkaesque.” She centers her purse on the bar, and after a few moments of patient searching, finds a tube of lip gloss, a small compact mirror, and a hair scrunchy. She pulls her shoulder-length hair back into a ponytail and refreshes her lips in layers of shocking red gloss, the color no doubt intended to contrast her auburn hair and direct attention away from what she considers an altogether too pronounced aquiline nose.\n",

      "1068 \tHis sudden appearance, like some dark angel, leaves her breathless. She looks into his dark eyes, follows the sharp contours of his face and the effortless flow of his shoulder-length hair, waiting to hear his voice. He leans closer still; she feels his breath hot on her face.\n",

      "1071 \t“Of course,” he whispers. Without taking his eyes off her, the man centers a frosted pilsner glass under the tap nearest Wendy and draws a tall draft beer. Foam overflows over the top of the mug down his hand. He slides the glass in front of Wendy, who takes it as if handling a consecrated host. Their hands touch briefly, and she notices his ring—a large, square onyx flanked like altar boys by tiny, glowing rubies.\n",

Still, Wendy stares into the ever-growing head, studying each bubble as a universe of its own. She wipes away a small tear and looks at the bartender. He produces a string of pearls and places them around Wendy's neck. She sets her drink down on the bar and clutches the pearls, holding them to her heart. The foam rises in great waves from her drink and soon sweeps across the entire bar and floor. Annoyed customers kick the stuff away but generally go about their business. Her bartender spreads his arms wide, and in that space there appears a vignette of floating worlds and tireless lovers chasing them.\n",

As they continue the “expired” chant, the hostess works her way through the crowd dragging along a matching pair of fleshy bouncers.\n",

In the middle of what was once a circular bar stands a broken marble pedestal about three feet high and several feet wide. On top is a black velvet couch encrusted with lichen and mold. An inscription at the base of the pedestal reads, “Memories of the Future. Visions of the Past.” The P is chipped away entirely. I run my hands over the inscription in a futile effort of acquiring some tactile knowledge of the strange message. Outside the thunder grows nearer and the flashes of lightning more frequent. A dry wind sweeps through the vacant building, kicking up clouds of dust.\n",

As I near the exit, a great flash of lightning and an ear-shattering clap of thunder lights a figure standing in the doorway. He stands weaving in the wind and grinning like a madman, holding plastic credit cards in each hand, waving them in some sort of bizarre fan-dance, chopping the air overhead.\n",

      "1129 \tI couldn't get a glimpse of the swim suite in the froth, but her voice was a choir of angels. She was sitting low with her arms stretched out to either side. The water bubbled to just below her chin. Her long black hair danced in the froth like hungry tendrils. A single streak of silver running the distance of her hair shined in the sallow moonlight. In her right hand, she held an empty wine glass. \n",

After fumbling around with my eyes closed, I found the alarm clock and reset the damn thing. I felt like crap, and when I finally pried my eyes open, I felt even worse. The room was bathed in bright light. I jumped out of bed thinking I must have overslept—Peter. We were supposed to be on a plane back to Rochester at 9:00 AM. I stumbled around the room while my eyes adjusted to the light. Every blind was open, and the message light on the phone was blinking. I dialed the voice mail number and turned around—there was someone still in the bed. I dropped the phone. I could hear Peter's voice yelling something about being late as I walked slowly over the bed, trying to remember what had happened last night. Buried under the covers, I could see the outline of a woman; her long black hair was spread out over the pillow. As I reached for the covers, I had this feeling that I was in a horror movie and that something hideous was waiting under the sheets. I jerked back the blankets. Diane K. was lying there nude, face down. I couldn't see the face, but somehow I knew it was her. A small red and blue rose tattoo graced the small of her back, just above her ass. The detail in the flower was incredible; the branching veins along the petals were like worlds unto themselves. I bent down for a closer look. My face was an inch away when she flipped over and sat up. I backed away and looked up. It was her, I could tell from the silver streak that runs the length of her hair. The shock was her face—except for her mouth, it was completely blank. No eyes. No nose. Just a grinning mouth under a thick layer of beet-red lipstick.\n",

      "1260 \tThe road winds around as it climbs; the scenery was spectacular, and the traffic sparse, so I took my time. About a mile into the park, I noticed a cloud of dust in my rearview mirror. A few minutes later, the blur condensed into a car, and then finally a black Mustang, a Cobra by the look of it. The driver practically climbed up my ass as I approached a wide turn. It leaped out from behind me as we rounded the turn but didn't pass. We were on an open stretch of road that looked to be about a quarter mile. I slowed down, hoping the driver would pass, but the driver stayed with me. I slowed down even more. The other car kept pace. The passenger-side window came down, and the horn blew a few times. I turned and there was Diane K. with a huge smile on her face, waving at me.\n",
      "\n",
      "1261 \tI shouted over, “What do you want?”\n",

      "1263 \t“You're crazy!” I yelled to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "1264 \tNo answer. When I turned my attention back to the road, I saw a huge truck cab round the hairpin turn about an eighth of a mile away. No time to think—the truck was screaming down at us. Diane K. stayed in the left lane, still waving at me as if she hadn't a care in the world. I yelled something at her and slammed on the brakes. She stayed in the wrong lane as the truck raced toward her. A second later, there was a flash of light and a terrifying crunching sound as the truck slammed head on into Diane K. The Cobra sailed over my head. I came to a stop at the side of the road and watched her car smash nose first into a guardrail and then vanish over the edge. The truck kept going and was out of sight in a few seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "1265 \tI must have panicked or freaked out; I don't know. Next thing I remember is leaning over the guardrail, shouting into the depths below. A dead silence followed, and then a moment later, a woman's agonized scream.\n",
      "\n",
      "1266 \t“I'm coming!” I shouted back and jumped over the rail without thinking. I landed on a bed of gravel, lost my footing, and tumbled down a steep embankment. I can remember hitting rocks and tree limbs as I rolled uncontrollably. Then I hit something large and hard, a boulder or tree. I don't know, but I lost consciousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "1267 \tHow long was I out? I had no idea, but it must have been a while. When I finally opened my eyes, all was blackness. I didn't know if it was night or I was blind. My head pounded; I had no feeling in my left arm. There was a rustle of motion close by, and somewhere out in the darkness, someone was moaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "1268 \t“Who's there?”\n",
      "\n",
      "1269 \tMy words fell flat in the dead air. I strained against the silence and could hear the smallest sound, a muffled cry for help. I stretched out my arms in the dark and inched my way in the general direction of the noise. My left arm felt like so much dead weight, as if it were someone else's arm instead of my own.\n",
      "\n",
      "1270 \tAnother moan, prolonged and clearer. I must be getting close. My eyes were gradually adjusting to the feeble light of a tiny sliver of moon. It was enough to make out some small shapes ahead of me—bushes, trees, and then a black car flipped over on its top.\n",
      "\n",
      "1271 \t“I see you,” I shouted. “I'm almost there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "1272 \tA faint voice said, “No. Go back.”\n",
      "\n",
      "1273 \tThe moon peeked out behind a cloud. I could clearly make out Diane K.'s Cobra lying in a dense thicket. I sped up a little. There was a soft rush of motion behind me, like a small animal clawing through the underbrush. I sped up a little more.\n",
      "\n",
      "1274 \t“Hang on, almost there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "1275 \t“Go back!” her voice sounded stronger and terrified.\n",
      "\n",
      "1276 \tThen several things happened all at once. A sharp, guttural noise, a cross between the growl of a wounded animal and the scream of a madman, pierced the air. It was unlike any sound I've ever heard or even imagined, as if the agony of every creature on the planet was somehow channeled to this exact spot. Then a loud crack, like a tree being snapped in two, except it wasn't a tree. It was my own legs. I screamed and collapsed. The pain was a flash of fire that shot up both legs, through my torso, into my brain, and back down again. It was as if something had fired white-hot spikes into my knees. I screamed again and flailed my arms at whatever invisible enemy was out there. More blows came in rapid succession—to my head, arms, and body. They kept coming and coming, faster and faster. I felt my sanity fading; and in my delirium, I saw myself suspended in a circle of hell, surrounded by half-beast, half-human abominations. The creatures all leaped on top of me, yet over the chaos and noise, I heard Diane K. shrieking in some unknown tongue. It was her voice—terrible and mad—that burned inside my head as I mercifully lost consciousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "1277  \n",

      "1278 \tThat same voice, just as intense but more controlled, woke me with a simple, “Hey—you there?”\n",
      "\n",
      "1279 \tI opened my eyes, realized I was lying flat on my back, and immediately sat up. “Yeah, I think so.” The space around me was open and featureless, as if I were sitting on a table top suspended in empty space, except that there were no stars. Diane K. was sitting cross-legged a few feet away. I said, “What happened? There was an accident, right?”\n",

      "\n",
      "1291 \tShe jumped to her feet and looked down at the center of her chest. I looked too and noticed a fist-sized red stain in the shape of a ring just about where her heart would be. “We don't have very long,” she said. Her voice seemed vacant and sad.\n",
      "\n",
      "1292 \t“For what?”\n",

      "\n",
      "1298 \t“That's no answer. Ah! Christ!” A sharp pain ripped into my neck and down my spine. I looked to Diane K. for some kind of explanation but saw the spot on her chest was wet with blood. Before my eyes, it enlarged to a hole you could poke a rolling pin through.\n",
      "\n",
      "1299 \t“We're waking up,” she tells me.\n",
      "\n",
      "1300 \t“So now what?”\n",

      "1301 \t“I think I can get us out of here, but you're going to have to trust me.”\n",

      "1303 \t“What happened to you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "1304 \t“I was impaled in the accident. Forget it. Bad planning—again.” As she talked, a bloody branch grew another foot or so. My head and legs started throbbing with a dull pain. My left arm dropped lifelessly to my side. Diane K. studied the branch, which was growing faster than Pinocchio's nose. “I'll be okay. Probably.”\n",
      "\n",
      "1305 \t“Sure you will.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "1308 \tEverything else vanished. I opened my eyes again. Leaning over me was face—at least I thought it was a face—but there were no eyes or nose, only a jagged, gaping maw hissing at me like a pissed-off pit viper. The thing was a walking nightmare from a Francis Bacon painting, but a face I recognized from years ago—St. Michael's School basement, a violent crime, and Father Berger.\n",
      "\n",
      "1309 \tI screamed. It screamed back, a sound that reached down my throat and pulled my insides out. More faces appeared, all of them hissing at me as if they were sharing a private joke. If that's what it was, it must have been hilarious. They waved claw-like appendages over my face, hissing with apparent glee as I shook my head wildly from side to side trying to avoid them. From somewhere close by, Diane K. started shouting in the creatures' hideous, guttural tongue. This seemed to agitate our demon captors even more.\n",
      "\n",
      "1310 \tSuddenly the hissing stopped. All but two of the faces above me disappeared. One pair of claws forced my mouth wide open, nearly cracking my jaw. I tried to struggle, but I was bound to a table or slab. Another face appeared directly over me—Diane K. Her face was ashen, her eyes burning. She made a facial gesture to the creatures. A claw appeared holding a hairy, black, wriggling monstrosity. If you could repackage insanity as an alien spider, this would be it. Diane K. made a strange grunting noise, gestured in my direction, and then clearly said, “Kill it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "1311 \tShe vanished from view. One of the creatures dropped the thing onto my chest and held my mouth open as it inched in spasmodic spurts toward my face.\n",
      "\n",
      "1312 \tThe alien spider, or whatever it was, reached my mouth and placed a tentative appendage on my lower lip. Wave after wave of fear ripped through my body. The thing on my chest just sat there, stroking my lips for what seemed like an eternity, pushing me to the edge of madness. From behind me, there was some sort of commotion. I heard Diane K. shrieking in that hideous language. The claws holding my mouth open disappeared. More screaming, and then suddenly, the thing on my chest leapt into the air and onto my face. I felt a sharp pain, like a thousand needles penetrating all at once, and then I must have lost consciousness.\n",

There was no publicity, no trial that I can recall. And then all traces of them just vanished, as if history had erased their memory. Scott and I, his mother, my folks—we never talked about it.

It started in my left arm and ran down my side and both legs. I tried unsuccessfully to move my legs. They seemed to be suspended or held in place. I told myself I need to open my eyes, and I tried, but I had this sudden vision of something black and horrible and squeezed my eyes shut tighter.

We feel our way into a large Victorian sitting room where a man and woman sit in front of a fire, a large panting Dalmatian stretched out nervously at their feet. Their avatars wear black Mardi Gras masks, no doubt to conceal their true identity. A young woman with the handle CheriBaby talks about controlling your dreams by sleeping with a pearl necklace under your pillow. The man, much older, tall and impossibly thin, calls himself PencilNeck, tries to convince us that there is no such thing as dreams; and even if there were, it would be the dreams that control us rather than the reverse. Scott and I are too wasted to make sense of any of this, and it doesn't matter anyway as we all have a good time until I get bored and insist we move on.\n",

Finally, we arrive in an expansive bar where we meet a tall, dark-haired man about my age, and a statuesque, red-haired woman some years younger. Again, the masks defeat any possible recognition, but there's plenty of beer on hand, so we stay and make pointless chitchat. The man, who says his name is OrbiX, works furiously behind the bar, mixing and sampling various combinations of liquors. The woman watches him amble between bottles as we ramble aimlessly about booze, technology, and sex.\n",

Between us is a leather-covered stool. She leans over it and pulls me toward her. I can smell her breath, her sex, and I raise my hand to her face, but it passes through as if she were a specter. She smiles, apologizes for having to leave, and whispers, “Bug Jar.” I turn to look for Scott and find him snoring in his seat in front of his computer monitor.\n",

I look up, and overhead is a reproduction of a fifties-style living room and kitchen, carefully nailed upside down to the ceiling. My eyes trace over a half-filled bowl of Rice Crispies, past a distended Slinky, a package of Maypo, up the sleek contours of a Frigidaire, to a sunburst clock that reads one thirty. Since I'm already an hour and a half late, I look for something familiar, and find Wendy sitting alone at the end of the bar. I pull up a stool beside her, order an espresso, and sit quietly, stirring blasphemous amounts of sugar into my coffee. We both stare into our own space, each waiting for the other to say something. \n",

She makes only token resistance. I look into her eyes, watching my own reflection in a mist that grows gradually and sends a small tear coursing down her cheek. Wendy wipes it away quickly, and with an almost imperceptible slowness, leans forward until her mouth is but a breath away. Our lips brush together, trembling, barely touching. She takes my hand and holds it against the softness of her cheek, then hides her face in my hand, kissing my palm, slowly, deliberately, leaving behind a trail of tears.\n",

Part two denies anything out of the ordinary and instructs me in iambic pentameter to “ignore the message that I got before.” I choose to ignore his second message and am positioned at his home's security buzzer in under twenty minutes.\n",

      "1442 \tHe releases the door without bothering to find out who it is. A grinning Peter is waiting in the spacious foyer. He pulls me in without ceremony or greeting. I follow him down the hallway past the family room where Molly sits naked at a shiny, black baby grand piano. I pause a moment to watch as she alternately pounds furiously on the keys and scribbles showers of notes onto music-notation paper. Shaves of incomplete and discarded music scores are piled on either side of her in waves about her feet. She notices me, looks up and smiles, and then returns to her music. Peter shrugs and mumbles something vaguely disparaging about musicians.\n",

      "1443  \tWe continue to a family room dominated by shoddy furniture and an entertainment system that covers an entire wall. He directs me to a stale gray couch, sits next to me, and offers a cigarette, a Camel Menthol.

      "1449 \tI turn and give Peter a “what the hell?” sort of look, but he just laughs. Molly appears, green tinted and clothed in a fluffy pink robe, giggling at some silent joke she shares with Peter, all the while fingering a neon-bright pearl choker the color of newly mowed grass. \n",

It's like peeing on the surface of a drum. A hopeful flush produces nothing but an annoying whine from somewhere in the netherworld of pipes. I peek through the crack in the door. Outside, the bedroom is bathed in a green ambiance from a fluorescent fog that had settled in throughout the house.

      "1456 \tWendy flits nervously as if expecting Nancy to suddenly appear. She pulls a cigarette out of her purse in anticipation of a few more tokes before entering the nonsmoking sanctuary of our accommodations. I park under a circle of dark trees at the back of the property. We sit there for a moment, staring straight ahead.\n",

Our first weekend together, me with twenty years of marriage under my belt, she with ten; and yet we still don't know what to do next or who's supposed to be doing it. \n",

      "\n",
      "1476 \tOur fingertips meet, and the effect is immediate. Wendy says, “Her last name—Anachronism. She some kind of hippie?” She scotches closer, throws her leg over mine. I pull her close, her face is inches from mine, her breath coming fast and hot. For an instant, I completely forget what the topic was and see only the desire in her eyes. She runs her tongue along her top lip.\n",

He drums nervously on the table and an open box of Rice Crispies. A permanent dark crescent adorning each roughly chiseled fingernail suggests a lifetime of tinkering with fate through automobiles. She quietly stirs a bowl of fresh fruit and stabs indecisively at overdone quiche. Wendy strikes up a conversation with Jeff that revolves roughly around the three B's: bowling, bars, and bathroom humor. Her abrupt outbursts of laughter, punctuated by an occasional snort, seems to amuse Jeff and slices the conversation into neatly digestible pieces like a verbal Veg-O-Matic. I trade covert glances with Karen. She looks vaguely familiar, although I can't recall the time or place.\n",

      "1480 \tKaren's silence is haunting. My eyes travel the length of the table, follow the delicately arched hands and crimson nails that reflect the morning sun, to her slender arms and long, graceful neck, and finally her piercing brown eyes. With one intense look, she assaults my soul, sending a psychic arrow through my body and across the room, dragging my insides with it. The breakfast clatter and chitchat fade into inane white noise. Together we stand up, eyes still locked on one another, and hands clasped, we make our own escape into the glowing morning. \n",
      "\n",
      "1481 \tThe patio leads to a hidden path that we follow for some time before reaching a wide beach on the shore of some ocean. Huge waves crash upon the sand, sending rivulets of warm water dancing at our feet. Karen strips, and I follow her lead. Standing nude in the mist like an ageless water nymph, she points to a rocky island in the distance and then leaps into the sea. I hesitate; the water looks inviting, yet I'm distracted by a large limbo party further down the beach. The partiers see me and wave excitedly, beckoning me to join their group. Karen swims toward the island without looking back, and it occurs to me that if I don't follow, she'll be lost forever. A massive wave breaks unexpectedly, sending me reeling back. The salt stings my eyes, and without a second thought, I glance back at the beach party, wave, then dive into the warm, churning sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "1482 \tStrange and wonderful sea creatures, glowing as living jewels, surround me like attendants at a royal wedding, teasing and nudging me forward. I suddenly realize that I can breathe the water. The sensation brings me back to a time in my dimmest memories—I can remember the water, the salt, a great, comforting, thumping sound—when I see Karen streaking ahead of me. Her feet are just beyond my touch, and I race forward to catch her. My hand barely brushes her ankle as she somersaults around me, and the touch sends a bolt of electricity arching at my fingertips and through my body. Again and again, she swims around me, tempting yet always staying just out of reach. We pass over a coral reef in the shallows near the island, then taking my hand, she pulls me out of the water and onto the rocky shore. \n",
      "\n",
      "1483 \tThe island enfolds us; and the rocks, sharp and rugged in the distance, are soft and inviting. She lays back, pulls me toward her, her neck arching back in hungry anticipation. My mouth finds her small breasts, tastes the small drops of salt water that mix with her own delicate beads of sweat. Her nipples rise to my touch, and she in turn finds me, pulling and gently stroking as I grow in her small hand. \n",
      "\n",
      "1484 \t“I want to make love with you,” she says with such a quiet energy that the ocean itself seems stilled. Then there is a moment where nothing exists, and time stands still as our lips touch, our tongues meet, and our bodies rise and fall with the waves beneath us.\n",
      "\n",
      "1485 \tWe make love as the sun rises and sets over us, watching as it edges toward the horizon, then is slowly nudged out of sight by gathering storm clouds. The strange magic of the day sweeps over me. I pull Karen closer, holding her tight—a life preserver keeping me afloat in our own reality. Karen nuzzles closer. She throws her arms around my neck and kisses my chest. “Our own reality,” I say to myself, not realizing I've said it out loud.\n",

      "\n",
      "1497 \tA blinding net of lightning flashes just off shore, followed by a huge clap of thunder. We both spring up as the rain starts. “We better get out of here,” I say looking around me. \n",

      "1498 \tThe rain attacks us in sheets. Karen kisses me tenderly and says, “I love you, Don.” I reach to caress her face, but before I can, she reaches out and takes my hand and gently touches it to her breast, then dives back into the restless sea. The waves swell in an embrace, pulling her out into the open water, but drives me back away from the shore and farther inland as the fierce storm erupts around me.\n",
      "\n",
      "1499 \tI desperately search the rocks, blinded by driving rain and sharp tongues of lightning. The storm drives me away from the shore and into a thick forest where I find eventually my clothes, dripping wet, hanging over a tree limb. I dress quickly and follow a nearby path. The storm diminishes to a light shower, and finally a murky drizzle by the time I reach the patio of the West Wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "1500 \tThe outside light barely manages to pierce a late-afternoon fog. I find the patio screen door and enter the dining area; the table has been set for the next morning. The house is quiet and enveloped in a tense darkness. As I walk into the somber living room, I find Wendy, packed bags at her side, sitting on a large country divan. She stares at me without expression behind a wall of tired, red eyes.\n",

      "\n",
      "1505       Outside, Karen and Jeff are screaming at each other. Wendy stares at the floor, her eyes darting to the rhythm of words “whore,” “bastard,” and worse. I hear a loud slap, one car door slams, and then the other. A racing motor screams out curses; rubber chews a path of betrayal over the wet pavement. I run to the window and catch a fleeting glimpse of Karen's face, and watch as receding tail lights steal her away. \n",

The woman stares at me and tries to smile, her face is ashen, her fingernails deadly weapons, her hair black and piled high on her head like a wedding cake.

As I have no description, only this vague notion of red hair and freckles, I have no idea who I'm looking for. I am drowning in a sea of hopeful singles. Guys with polished hair and half smiles, young women showing off pierced navels, boys flashing pierced eyebrows like weapons, bored housewives and cheating husbands, poets and sinners, and bartenders who preside over the whole affair, orchestrating the polite bartering of sex.\n",

Her tongue darts out to meet mine; they play hide-and-seek, pulling us together to a place where I feel I could crawl inside of her. The ceiling melts away, and the bar grows into a mountaintop overlooking a ring of rolling hills. Tables and chairs become erotic engineers that build and fill a Jacuzzi with steaming white wine; bottles and glasses become a string quartet. A wave of Debussy sweeps over us, dissolves our clothes, leads us into a frothing pool, and with hot wine spraying over our clenched bodies, we make love to the seductive rhythm of the music, the froth, and an anxious moon.

Soon I'm alone in the cavernous terminal except for one other customer, an older man dressed in a dark pin-striped suit wearing a straw hat, carrying a duck under one arm and holding a cane on the other. He also has taken his number and waits, patting the duck on the head and whispering to it as if it were a small child; the thing quacks affectionately, and I imagine that they are secretly talking about me in some weird Swedish duck language. \n",

      "1620 \tThe ticket windows are all closed and dark but for one where a large man in a blue uniform and mirrored sunglasses works feverishly, stamping forms of some kind, paying no attention to me sitting there waiting for number 1106 to be called. A damp wind sweeps through the building leaving a trail of leaves and ticket stubs behind; somewhere I hear a scratched recording of a miscellaneous European drinking song. Finally, the ticket salesman starts calling numbers beginning at 1101, and soon he calls my number. \n",
      "\n",
      "1621 \tI reach the window and greet him with “hey,” a stupid thing to do because that means “hello” in Swedish, which implies I understand Swedish, and so quite naturally he begins speaking Swedish. I have to stop him in midsyllable and tell him I don't understand a word. Fortunately, most Swedes speak excellent English and are happy to do so. The ticket salesman meets half of those criteria. \n",

      "1622 \t“What do you want?” he asks impatiently. \n",
      "\n",
      "1623 \tI tell him I need a round-trip ticket to Kiruna on the X-2000, the speed train, and he immediately howls with laughter. He hands me my tickets, charges the fare to my credit card, says “Spår 11,” and calls the next number. The old man with the duck gives me a friendly nod as he passes.\n",

      "1624 \tIn contrast to the empty terminal, platform eleven is busy with anxious travelers. A comely stewardess greets me and leads me to a seat in first class, close to the door leading to the dining car. I make myself comfortable and pull out a book. The Duck Man takes a seat directly across the aisle from me. A tall, athletic woman about my age passes down the aisle and asks if the seat across and facing me is taken. I tell her it isn't. She smiles and removes her fur coat, revealing a stunning and tight-fitting green velvet dress. Her face is hidden in waves of piercing red hair. As she settles into her seat, I notice the long strands of pearls that sweep around her neck and settle comfortably between her small, firm breasts. Moments later, announcements in Swedish and English foreshadow our departure. \n",

      "1627 \tThe other passengers have quickly adopted their travel rituals: both man and duck across the aisle nap and snore contentedly. The woman across from me is intently reading a worn novel. I watch her eyes dance across the page, the occasional smile from some moving passage, and wonder what she is reading. Peering over the top of my own P. D. James mystery, I see an unfamiliar Swedish title, but a familiar author, D. W. Maguire. I ponder the meaning just long enough for my glance to turn into a stare. She must sense my curiosity, and setting aside her book, says, “A good read. Strange perhaps, but perfect for a long journey. How far are you traveling?”\n",

Odd name, don't you think? I heard that it was named after the mistress of a colonial settler. Or was it his mother? And there was another place. Native American I think. Iron something . . .” she thinks for a moment then blurts out, “Irondequoit. That's it. Have you ever heard of it?”\n",

      "1637 \tWe ride in silence, each of us lost in our own novels. The train tips and sways to compensate for the lack of banked tracks on curves, and the effect leaves me slightly nauseous.

The conductor repeats his demand, louder in a sadistic growl, and the passenger reluctantly hands him his ticket. He snatches it out of the terrified man's hand and punches it with some sort of hand punch. Instantly the passenger's face blanks out. I jump forward in my seat, which arouses the attention of Lynette and wakens the Duck Man. Yet it's true, the man's face has simply vanished, leaving in its place a veneer of featureless skin. The conductor hands the man back his ticket, which he takes and places in his vest pocket before returning to reading his paper, although how he accomplishes this without eyes is a mystery. The scene repeats itself for every passenger, and soon the first ten rows are filled with faceless people either oblivious or indifferent to their bizarre condition. As he is now but five rows ahead of mine, I turn to the Duck Man for advice.\n",

      "1642 \tLynette turns to me and asks what's going on. I explain the situation, and she turns around to see the faceless persons behind her. Judging from her reaction, I suspect that she didn't believe me at first, but is now shockingly convinced. \n",

As he centers his punch over the ticket, the Duck Man vaults out of his seat, and in a single smooth motion telescopes the duck's neck like a piece of stiff taffy. The body jerks pitifully under his arm, the neck and head writhe like a serpent, which he tames by pulling it taut until it stiffens. It lengthens in his hand, forming a spear with the duck's beak as the point.\n",

My trousers, chaps, and shirt are all covered in dust. I brush myself off, but before I can finish preening, a great slap on the back hurls me inside against the bar. A big, friendly guy with a drooping mustache big enough to hide his mouth and chin immediately slaps down a whopping big beer in front of me.\n",

      "1654 \tA loud, friendly voice shouts, “Where the hell've you been?” \n",
      "\n",
      "1655 \tThe beer is an oasis of refreshment. “Well, up until a few minutes ago, I was on a train in Sweden, heading toward the Arctic Circle.” This comment is greeted by howls of laughter from the group of cowboys surrounding me, my friends apparently. I look at the faces in the group, and sure enough, I know every one. \n",
      "\n",
      "1656 \t“Sweden!” says the cowboy. “Damn, you sure are one funny son of a bitch, you know that? Where in Satan's underwear do you come up with this stuff? Sweden? Whatta you think of that, boys?” The boys laugh their collective prairie asses off. The cowboy, whose name is Max, reminds me of my childhood friend of the same name. I risk asking him about growing up in Batavia on the off chance it's him. He swats me on the back again, nearly knocking me over the bar, and screams with laughter. \n",
      "\n",
      "1657 \t“You get funnier every day. You know that? Batavia . . . Where in the blue balls of a dead coyote is Batavia? Somewhere in Utah?” The boys all laugh again. I do too. I guess it is pretty funny.\n",

      "1658 \tWe buy and drink more beer than I've ever had in one sitting in my life. It seems I'm the leader of an itinerant band of outlaws in this small town in the Texas panhandle. A calendar behind the bar gives the year as 1841. In keeping with the Old West cliché, there is a badly out of tune piano, a pool table, and an older man in a red striped shirt, who I recognize as the Duck Man, busy banging out drinking songs to the bawdy laughter of saloon girls and cowboys. Leaning against the piano is a long, ornate walking stick, the handle of which is carved into the shape of a duck's head. Shots and beer are everywhere, and every five minutes or so, someone sails a bottle or a cue ball across the room where it knocks out some unfortunate cowboy until someone splashes beer on his face to revive him. \n",
      "\n",
      "1659 \tThe party goes on for hours, days maybe, as all sense of time are lost to the bottomless mug of beer and shots of whiskey. Although there are countless fights, no one ever gets injured, and even the occasional duel has no casualties. And every Western movie I've ever seen has a tough-guy sheriff, but no sheriff ever appears. This must be cowboy heaven. I turn to say this to Max when I feel a delicate gloved hand stroke my cheek. \n",

      "1663 \tShe tilts her head and laughs, a long, sensuous laugh revealing her long neck. She puts both arms around my neck. “You always were one with the jokes,” she says. “I can make you forget all about Sweden.” \n",
      "\n",
      "1664 \tHer face is inches from mine; I feel her hot, sweet breath against my face. She pushes her hips into mine, stepping between my legs, and with one quick thrust grabs my complete attention. Her dark green eyes look deep inside me, and in an instant the music stops, the saloon is quiet, dark, and empty. She flicks her tongue, lightly licking my cheek and the tip of my nose, then again against my lips. I respond and lick her lips, tracing a line down her neck between her breasts, and back again. Her mouth opens in hungry response as she searches for and locks tight against mine, her tongue darting and exploring at will. Without realizing what's happening, we claw at each other's clothes, removing what we can, moving out of the way what we can't, and stretch out onto a nearby pool table. With her anxious body lying before me, I am consumed with only satisfying her, each caress, each thrust, gentle at first then gradually more forceful, directed at bringing her to climax. My mind switches off, turning inward to a darker self that senses without thought. I don't feel her nails as they dig deep into my back, or the blood trickling down, yet I am one with her as she arches her back high, pressing me away and drawing inside her at the same time in waves of pleasure as I explode deep into her.\n",

      "1667 \tI know what to say, but before I can, rough hands grab my shoulder and pull me off the pool table and throw me onto the floor. I struggle to get up, but fists of steel crash upon my head, sending me to the floor again in a pool of blood. I can hear manic cursing in Swedish as I stagger to my elbows and lift my head up to face my attacker. Through the blood, I see the train conductor, dressed in black and wearing a black hat. He stands over me screaming insanely, yet somehow I struggle to my feet. Lynette grabs a bottle and attempts to hit him, but he's too fast. He grabs her arm, forcing her to drop the bottle, and with a quick, cruel backhand, knocks her out cold. She collapses at my feet, breathing heavily and moaning in pain. The conductor beats his chest with his fists, proclaiming a sick victory.\n",
      "\n",
      "1668 \tHis maniacal gloating gives me enough time to get dressed and pull her clear. I grab the same bottle she had dropped and face the conductor, ready for a fight I'm likely to lose. He turns toward me, produces a short bullwhip, and with one clean, invisible flash, breaks the bottle in my hand into showers of glass. My hand is cut and bleeding; there is no feeling in my fingers, and it feels like my hand is broken. The conductor lashes out again, and the whip slices into my shirt and cuts a deep gash into my right arm. Instinctively I cover the wound with my other hand and fall helpless against the bar. I see only his cruel face as he stretches out his whip and presses it against my neck, choking the life slowly from me. I hear Lynette's agonizing moans and stare into the two blank spots on the conductor's face where eyes should be. He curses in an evil hiss in a breath that smells of dead insects; the sounds and lights all mingle in a swirling web of psychosis, draining my energy and pulling me closer to death. A loud, clear voice says, “Duck!” and with my last shred of strength, I manage to duck my head under a flash of steel that cleaves the head off the conductor, sending it sailing gracefully through the air, doing several somersaults before landing upside down on the bar. \n",
      "\n",
      "1669 \tThe conductor's body goes instantly limp, but instead of the expected shower of blood, a flood of gas pours out of the exposed neck, sending the body racing randomly around the room like a large balloon that was blown up then let go. It bounces chaotically then lands on the floor in front of the Duck Man. He picks up the flaccid body with his sword, tossing it casually aside. \n",
      "\n",
      "1670 \t“Close one that time,” he says cheerfully. “I don't think he'll be back, but you never know with that chap.” \n",
      "\n",
      "1671 \tThe conductor's head meanwhile is steadily cursing and rocking itself, apparently trying to get away. I stare at it in amusement as the Duck Man dresses the wound on my arm caused by the bullwhip. Together we tend to Lynette's injuries. Fortunately she isn't seriously hurt, but her nose looks broken. The Duck Man pulls the ornately carved figure off his walking stick and unscrews the carved figure, handing the flask to Lynette. She takes a small drink then hands it to me. I sip the golden liquid, sending a wave of heat through my entire body. \n",

      "1672 \tHe says, “That should take the edge off.”\n",
      "\n",
      "1673 \tMeanwhile, the screaming head has worked itself up into a frenzy, and as we three watch in astonishment, it sprouts large, black wings from its ears. The face morphs into a mottled green and yellow horror. The gaping maw sprouts long fangs, which it uses to pull itself toward the edge of the bar where it begins flapping, and slowly but steadily it gains altitude. \n",
      "\n",
      "1674 \t“I think it's time to go,” the Duck Man says. He leads us into a back room of the bar with the flying head close behind. \n",

      "1680 \tI fumble around and find myself in a pitch-black room about four feet square. Fumbling over the walls, I locate what feels to be a light switch. I press it and become enveloped by a flood of light. When my eyes finally adjust, I find myself alone, apparently back on the train and in a small lavatory. I take the opportunity to use the facilities and check the wound on my arm. It feels better, but a nasty scab still remains; it hurts to make a fist with my left hand. I step out of the lavatory and into a most unusual dining car.\n",

      "1681 \tA smiling hostess is there to greet me. \n",

      "\n",
      "1685 \tI search my pocket and produce two one-pound coins, which I hand to the hostess. She directs me to one of the many feeding stations that hang limply from the ceiling of the car. It is shaped like an elongated udder, smooth, hairless, and presumably sanitary. The length is apparently adjustable as a woman and her small son are feeding nearby, both with considerable comfort and ease, the appendage hanging at about chin level in both cases. Mine seems a bit high, so I give it a tentative tug to lower it. It protests some, dribbling a thin stream of brown liquid. A man standing next to me, an ordinary-looking gent in a business suit, is slurping loudly, all the while moaning in a most embarrassing fashion, as are all the patrons of the dining car, but still managing to concentrate on his copy of the Daily Telegraph. I turn away and face my own feed pipe. It rises above my head, widening at the top where it attaches to the ceiling like a large hair follicle. The surface of the ceiling is a ribbed structure, and following one of the beams from the ceiling to the wall, I see it curves gracefully around with the other beams so as to form a sort of tunnel. The beams are a dull red color, and what seemed at first to be electrical wires are massive arteries pulsating with blue black blood. In an instant, I realize that the dining car is formed from the insides of some hideous creature, the feeding apparatus some foreign organ. Hiding my panic, I glance out the window to find the sunny English countryside rolling by. The hostess senses my chagrin and assumes I need assistance.\n",

My book is still on the seat; outside it is night, and peering into the darkness, I see it snowing lightly, and the ground is covered in a silent cover of snow. Lynette and most of the other passengers are asleep, but my companion sitting across from me, a Rubenesque woman with auburn hair, seems awake, her face hidden behind a Swedish newspaper. I reach into my travel sack, extract my lexicon, and find the Swedish phrase for “How far to the next stop?” She doesn't answer, so I repeat myself slower, thinking that I must have mispronounced something. In a flash, she drops her paper, and sitting there two feet away is Wendy. \n",

      "1694 \tI can't imagine how she knows about Lynette, but it seems immaterial. I figure that all women must know when their lovers are cheating.

      "1696 \t“Friends? How dare you suggest we be friends after all this.” She waves her arms frantically to suggest “this.” Her tirade disturbs everyone else in the car, who observe pensively as if watching a soap opera. “You can keep your damn pearls too,” she screams, yanking the pearl necklace that I gave her from around her neck and throwing it at my head. I duck and they sail into the next row where the Duck Man deftly snatches them from the air and hands them to Lynette. Quite suddenly and from out of nowhere, Wendy flashes a large handgun and waves it menacingly. I pray for help, thinking the Duck Man will come to my rescue once again; but no, he watches at a distance holding Lynette's hand, evidently unsure of what to do. \n",

Those blank membranes stare at me in fear and loathing for just an instant before he loses balance and topples into the space between the cars onto the track.

      "1713 This is how long it takes a taxi to travel from Heathrow to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea: (0. It takes an infinite amount of time, and during rush hour it can even take longer. Longer than infinity. George Cantor was right. I knew it, but I've never experienced it directly. And so, lost in this London koan, I arrive after an infinite amount of time at the lobby of the flats where my new project manager awaits within. With a gaggle of suitcases by my side, I engage in this delightful banter with the desk clerk of Queensgate, who eventually produces my room key and the flat number of Bernard C., the independent consultant I am destined to be cyberchained to for the next several months.\n",
      "\n",
      "1714 \tAfter throwing my stuff in my own room, I walk down the hall to Bernie's flat and lift the knocker tentatively a few times. A delightful female voice says, “Just a minute please.” She practically sings the words. I can hear soft footsteps approaching; a moment later, the door swings opens with the greeting, “Hi, I'm Martha.” She extends a hand. I reach out, but instead of a polite shake, she pulls me inside and hugs me warmly, the same kind of hug you might give an ex at a high school reunion. She is barefoot and tiny—no more than five feet—and has to stand on her tiptoes. Her short, curly locks, done up Betty Boop style, had a hint of vanilla and pine. “And you must be Don,” she says releasing me.\n",

The room is awash in waves of patchouli incense. Martha lets go of my hand. “Bernie, company,” she announces. She skips out of the room through a pair of swinging double doors.\n",

We strategically arrange the collection of stainless steel serving dishes so that nothing is more than a stab away and chat about the job. Bernie makes copious notes in a hardbound diary. The dinner winds down, and we cap it off with a dessert round of more beer. The lights dim, and the manager or owner comes out onto the stage. He nods at Bernie and then introduces the musicians. There's a round of polite applause; someone in the audience shouts out, “Bring on Sevi.”\n",

The sitarist is lovely, her features dark, haunting; a small crimson gem pierces her nose, reflecting ambient light like a tiny red star. She looks vaguely familiar, so I study her a little closer.

Wielding her instrument like an ax, she brings it down on the nearest tabla player, splitting his skull open and sending his drum careening across the floor. Patrons scream as she twists the neck of her instrument, releasing a gleaming, barbed foot-long blade, and thrusts it through the body of the flute player, leaving a small jetsam of flesh dangling off the end like a severed worm. The second tabla player jumps up; but before he can escape, the sitarist swings her blade overhead and brings it down on the terrified musician, cutting him in half lengthwise. On the back swing, she lops off both feet as the halves of his body fall in opposite directions onto the floor in a pool of gore. Throughout this mayhem, the poet has stood frozen in place. The sitar player turns to her and screams, “Run!”\n",

They escape out the front entrance, running past, and in some cases, on top of stunned customers. The sitar player watches this bizarre sight with apparent glee. Then her demeanor changes as she wheels around and flashes a look of contempt at Bernie and me, sitting there dumfounded at our table. With a high-pitched scream that sounds more animal than human, she lunges at us. The sword crashes down in the center of the table, splitting it as if it were balsa. With another shriek, she swipes the sword over our heads, missing us by inches. Bernie throws a bottle at her, distracting her momentarily. With a well-placed kick, she sends me reeling backward onto the floor. Bernie yells again and throws another bottle, but with no apparent affect. She circles over me with her sword poised high, ready to strike. I look around feverishly for something, anything to throw, but am unlucky enough to have landed in a spot clear of rubble. \n",

Twisting it at the other end is Bernie. He gives a sharp pull, extracting it partway through her body, followed by another violent push. It reappears glistening with blood. She looks over her shoulder and snarls at Bernie, sounding more annoyed than hurt. With little effort, she grabs the bloodied spear with one hand, pulls it the rest of the way through her body, and tosses it aside. She turns on Bernie who is standing behind her waving a broken beer bottle.\n",

It is as if some lunatic god has driven a nail and pierced the skin of the heavens. Karen and I stare up at the London summer sky, frightened but amused. Hypnotized by wailing sirens of disaster, people scurry out of their nests and point to the sky, not sure if they are witnessing the end of the world or some massive publicity gimmick. But a glowing crimson streak spreads across the afternoon sky like a bucket of red paint tossed into a swift stream. Amidst the noise and confusion that follow, we hear the polished voice of a well-known BBC-2 announcer from a TV directly below us. The report states that the Royal Society vigorously denies rumors of global environmental disaster or terrorist attack.\n",

Our lunch celebrating her recent divorce suffers from an oppressive spring humidity and lack of attention, and now seems strangely irrelevant. A sanguine radiance reflects across Karen's face as she stares at the wounded sky. A ginger thought, and with a single motion, she swipes food, glasses, and dishes off the table and into the mews below. I pull her across the table and cover her open mouth with mine. She grabs an open bottle of Claret and pours it over our faces; our tongues intermingle over the wine and saliva. Karen licks my face hungrily. She pulls my shirt off, licking my chest and down toward my belly.\n",

Thrusting into each other, I look at her hands—each is blighted with a gaping wound that passes through her palm, and as we approach climax, I feel wounds open in my own hands. The pain shoots up my arms and across my back; her nails dig deeper, leaving a furrow that quickly fills with fresh blood. \n",

As I whisper those words back, I find her there next to me, transported in an instant to my side. My loyal chaperone, the Van, turns the key in the ignition and plays “Unchained Melody” on the CD. It closes the blinds and produces a glowing scented candle from the dashboard and a light spring mist. We fall into each other's arms and kiss with a passion worthy of months of separation, and with no other thought in the world, we undress each other and make quiet love on the reclined front seat.\n",

The woman looks up, recognizes Karen, and before Gwynn can provide the necessary introductions, the two warmly embrace. I shoot a puzzled look to Karen who provides a sheepish explanation. “You remember Jean? I totally forgot to mention that her and her fiancée would be joining us this weekend. I'm sorry.”\n",

Among other things, we learn not to take blotter acid with apple wine, and how well-endowed members of various bands are (or were).

Because I'm Brian Donald Bacon XIV, that's why. And why should that make any difference?

The El Dorado Shuttleport won't land the faster planes (yes, we still call them planes—the name just stuck), so I'm looking at an hour-long flight minimum.\n",

This one is unoccupied but handsomely furnished in the southern or masshi style, usually preferred by younger wives.

Shards of stereo, digital sound, and picture explode in the small room. There's no one nearby to yell at me, or ask why I have done such an idiotic thing, or even suggest an alternative diversion. I regret my action, but only because I have ruined a perfectly good book. In its agonizing electronic death throes, my TV crawls into the corner, gasping through the smoke and ozone that still pour out of its shattered picture tube. I watch the spectacle for some time because I simply lack the energy to do anything else. When I finally do retrieve my book, the vicious appliance retaliates with its last few amps of strength. It lashes out violently when I reach into the set's viscera through the ring of broken glass that was once my window to global entertainment. I automatically jerk my hand back, dropping the book on the floor in front of the set. The cut across my palm is deep and bleeds in hopeless spurts onto the carpet. My final, senseless act of revenge is a well-placed kick to the simulated-wood-grain cabinet, which crushes the power button and sends the channel selector sailing into the next room. The television, either dead or unconscious, lies silent. I pick up my prize, a hardcover volume of Delta of Venus by Anaïs Nin, and leaf through the pages, leaving trails of blood from the wound in my hand.

      "2099 \tThe room is chilled, not cold. I don't want to live in a cold room; but I need to see my breath, need to know that I am still breathing, and how else would I know? The logical solution is to crank up the air conditioner. That's better, goddamn thing is amazing, but now my hands are freezing. Maybe a small fire in the middle of the room, away from the drapes and rugs, would help. I build it right under an AC vent, so I can still see my breath. I'll need a mirror, so I grab one from the bedroom and set it nearby—next to the packs of cigarettes, the small jar of spiders, pill bugs, and centipedes, and the plate of raw meat. Of course, I won't eat the meat. That wouldn't be politically correct. Still, it needs to be there just in case. I don't notice the smell in the cold, but at least it won't break up with me. No! I will beat it to the punch. I stand up, naked and glorious, a shining example of the grace of God, and proclaim to the plate of meat, to the jar of spiders, to the mounds of paper, to her countless pictures and cigarette butts, to the small bonfire burning in the center of my living room, to the images of the entwined couple flashing on my TV—I break up with all of you, for now and forever. \n",

      "2105 \tI forget about going to the bathroom and instead throw more paper onto the fire, more copies of her picture. It erupts suddenly, a solar flare that lights the interior of my small house; and in that instant I see her everywhere again, and the tears that flow from each pair of eyes, on each picture, drip red with blood. Through translucent walls, I hear her moans of pleasure beneath him, his rising breath and pounding heart, and watch as she urges him, louder, louder, and their screams of climax echo endlessly, shattering my brain. I cry out, and from somewhere above me, a woman's hand appears and drops a knife onto my lap. The hand hovers a moment; long fingernails painted the color of heated blood reflect demons from the fire. A mouth opens up in the hand. It happens with a nauseating slowness as a thin line draws delicate beads of blood across the palm and then unfolds to a pair of full lips painted a shimmering black. I won't talk to the hand. I look away and clutch the knife like a bloodied life preserver. A clear voice fills my head, “You can thank me later.”\n",

      "2128 \tAmanda stayed with the paramedics as they strapped Don onto a gurney. I walked around the house and surveyed the damage. There were piles of paper and half-empty food containers strewn all over the house. In his office, a pair of computers repeated the same twenty-second sound clip: “There's something you need to know—I've been involved with someone else for some time now . . .” I listened for a minute before shutting them both down, then I followed a trail of papers and pictures of Karen to the bedroom.\n",

The $4.95 price tag was still attached. Still in place under clear plastic were a magnifying glass, a fake plastic bug, an official CIA badge, a gun, and a notebook.

They scan silently; maybe they're looking for something, or maybe they're just watching my friends and me as we dance through the hourless days. The eyes leave manna for us; it mysteriously appears beneath the small window. I tell my friends that the window is a portal to the home of the gods, and to truly attain divine grace, we must do obeisance to them. I compose a suitable ritual that we perform daily. I know this works as each time we perform the ritual, the eyes reappear. We supplicate the gods to appear before us. This, you know, is religion.\n",

I refer to myself as crazy only because Dr. Frank says that recognizing that there is a problem is half a problem solved, and “crazy” somehow sounds better than “loony.” She insists that any such epithet only serves to perpetuate the popular stereotype of the mentally ill. I agree and tell the members of my group that the whole thing is most likely a result of bad karma. Sitting next to me is Wayne, a living cliché of a middle-aged hippie. He suggests I did too much blotter acid in college. Susan, a divorced mother of four, tells me I can't handle rejection.\n",

      "2220 \t“I love you, Don,” she says looking into my eyes. She is about to say more, but I raise a finger to her lips. \n",
      "\n",
      "2221 \t“I love you too,” I say and kiss her deeply. \n",
      "\n",
      "2222 \tHer body enfolds around me, drawing me inside her. Wendy pulls me closer, but abruptly draws away. She takes my hands, and in a voice laced with emotion says, “But there is something you need to know—” \n",
      "\n",
      "2223 \tNot again. A wave of panic passes through me.\n",
      "\n",
      "2224 \n",

      "2225 \tThen I wake up, alone in the spa.\n",
      "\n",
      "2226 \tI jump out, grab a towel, and head back to the bedroom where Jean lies naked, face down and sound asleep. I cover her and notice the flashing voice-mail light on the hotel phone. Karen's recorded voice is hollow and tense, fighting each word.\n",
      "\n",
      "2227 \t“I heard you and Jean were in town. It took a while to track you down, but I want to invite you to dinner tonight. We have a place on Madeira Beach. Please call if you can make it.” She leaves an unfamiliar address and telephone number. I can't believe the luck—she must have rung Peter. I glance at Jean's shivering figure, think of a likely excuse, and quickly dial Karen's number. Her voice mail answers.\n",
      "\n",
      "2228 \t“I'll be there at seven.” I hang up before I say something stupid.\n",
      "\n",
      "2229 \tJean stirs and rolls over; her face looks sallow and sad. She asks in a weak voice, “Is your friend gone?”\n",
      "\n",
      "2230 \t“Yeah.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2231 \t“Some guardian angel. Who was on the phone?”\n",
      "\n",
      "2232 \tI can hear myself saying, “Just an old friend,” but something in Jean's eyes stops me from doing so. She smiles and takes my hand. “Here's to wishes coming true.” She kisses my hand and then lies back down and pulls the covers over her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "2233 \t“To wishes coming true,” I whisper. \n",

      "2236 \tJean lays in the dark, feigning sleep for an hour before forcing herself to shower. She lets steam fill the small bathroom. Slowly, she lowers the water temperature to warm, then tepid, and finally to an ice-cold stream. Beads of ice form in her hair that she shakes free like living diamonds. She walks wet and nude into the bedroom, dropping ice crystals along the way, and sits at the edge of the bed staring down at the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "2237 \tTen minutes later, the phone rings. She finally looks up on the fourth ring. She reaches over in slow motion, picks up the receiver, holds it to her ear. A moment later, she says, “He's not here. Who is this?”\n",
      "\n",
      "2238 \tShe stands up and pulls a cotton bathrobe over her body as she listens to the caller. “I don't know when he'll be back. Who is this? Molly who? Oh, right, Peter . . . It's like I said . . . But . . . how did you know . . . Hello?” Jean looks into the receiver and makes a sour face, as if that would bring Molly back on the line.\n",

      "2245 \tI do so, slower than expected. Karen leans forward and takes the shaker like a sacramental. It levitates in her hand, rising miraculously several inches above her palm, hovering there for a moment before gently floating back down.\n",
      "\n",
      "2246 \tShe overseasons her soup.\n",
      "\n",
      "2247 \tI study her carefully, watching each line in her face. Through a veil of sadness, her beauty is still flawless, overwhelming. A silent storm passes between us, over the bare wooden table, the tarnished silver and cracked china, the flea-market mugs and screw-top wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "2248 \t“You've put too much on,” I tell her.\n",
      "\n",
      "2249 \tShe seems not to notice and tentatively sips her cold soup, head down, eyes staring straight into her meal through untamed bangs. Bare feet scratch away paint chips from her chair. They flake to the floor and are quickly lost. \n",
      "\n",
      "2250 \tShe looks up just long enough to say, “I like my soup salty. Don't you remember?”\n",
      "\n",
      "2251 \tI don't. “Of course I do. Pass the pepper.” \n",
      "\n",
      "2252 \tShe does so. \n",
      "\n",
      "2253 \tI wave the shaker vigorously over my soup. The spice leaks out like sputtering incense, cascading in waves behind a loosened shaker top. A tiny insect crawls to the surface and scampers down the slope of spice. Karen stares at the escaping bug but continues sipping silently, scratching the paint from her chair and the polish from her toenails.\n",
      "\n",
      "2254 \t“I'll get the meat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2255 \tShe does so, a red crock of tepid stew. Looking past me, she spoons some into my plate and serves herself a smaller portion. She manages a few brave forkfuls, but no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "2256 \t“Thanks for calling, Karen. It's been a long time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2257 \tShe nods without looking up and mumbles something into her dinner that sounds like, “glad you could make it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2258 \t“Kind of ironic you should call when I'm at the Vinoy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2259 \tKaren tilts her head with a little half smile, as if she has no idea what I'm talking about. From the vague expression, I'm guessing she doesn't remember that we made love there once, on a huge king-sized bed in a room overlooking Tampa Bay. One of us kicked over half a bottle of warm Chardonnay; it remained undiscovered until late the next morning. She won't remember that either.\n",
      "\n",
      "2260 \t“Anyway, thanks for the dinner. I'm glad you're doing okay, and I love your place. A little cozy, but hell, waterfront property on Madeira Beach? You done good.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2261 \tA hint of a smile flashes across Karen's face. She studies her plate, stirring the food with her fork, making little eddies and currents in the thin gravy. I watch her scratch out the last two years of our lives in tiny sculptures of potatoes and carrots. She doesn't seem to notice the animated diorama on her plate—there I am, cheating on her for the sheer drama of it, pleased with myself after sending her things back, desperate after she started seeing someone else. That wasn't supposed to happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "2262 \t“Yeah, I done good,” she repeats. “We're going to Daytona next weekend.” \n",
      "\n",
      "2263 \tThe idea that there is a “we” still slices through me like a thousand paper cuts. She is about to say more, I think, but the trace of romance on her lips vanishes along with half-full plates. She piles dishes in heaps in the sink and explains that the dishwasher has been on the fritz for weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "2264 \tStanding by the sliding glass door off the kitchen, Karen pulls back the curtain. She studies the full moon and misty evening air. \n",
      "\n",
      "2265 \tI stand a respectful distance next to her. “Maybe we could meet for lunch sometime? Tomorrow, or next time I'm in town.”\n",

      "2266 \t“Next time?”\n",
      "\n",

      "2268 \t“Surprised?”\n",
      "\n",
      "2269 \t“Yeah, and pleased. I'd like to meet your new guy,” I say in a big brother voice. Of course, there is no new guy, just the same old one.\n",

      "\n",
      "2271 \t“Well, maybe next time.”\n",

      "2272 \t“Not a problem,” she says in a whisper. “Sorry about the meal.” \n",
      "\n",
      "2273 \tI move closer and place my hands on her shoulders. She remains still as death. Outside, Madeira Beach glows in the distance under a rising moon. I hear anxious voices rise over the sound of Karen's labored breathing. “Limbo lower now,” they chant to the sound of steel drums. I can imagine shadows struggling under a taut rope stretched inches above the sand.\n",

      "2278 \tI nod, walk across the room to the fridge, and survey the contents for anything remotely drinkable. Under the flickering light, a can of light beer remains. Hidden in the back behind the beer and a half-full jar of dill pickles is a single cupcake, a mound of creamy chocolate frosting wrinkled and stiff. A lone candle, one of those novelty candles of the kind you can't blow out, is planted in the center, and I remember that Karen's birthday is this week. I push the beer aside, take out the cupcake, and after finding some kitchen matches next to a pack of Marlboros, light the candle. It sputters in the heavy air. I pull the string overhead killing the light, plunging the room into a cloying darkness. I hear Karen's quiet breathing across the room; the feeble candlelight casts a shadow of the bare bulb overhead, swinging like a gallows against naked walls.\n",

      "\n",
      "2280 \tFor a brief moment, her face glows in the light; the candle flares suddenly, sending tiny roman candles cascading against the walls of the small room. She takes the cake like a sacramental, and it levitates in her hands. As it slowly rises, her hands begin to tremble. The cupcake wobbles in midair like a crippled flying saucer; beads of sweat, sanguine in the dim light, break out over her forehead as she struggles to control the shaking in her hands.\n",

      "2281 \t“I'm so afraid,” she says, her voice barely a whisper.\n",

      "2283 \tThe cupcake tips over; it falls to the floor frosting-side down, extinguishing the flame. Karen buries her face in her hands and says, “Where this is going? Where I'm going?”\n",
      "\n",
      "2284 \tShe wipes away the sweat trickling down her face and kneels down to pick up the mess. A thin wisp of smoke still rises from beneath a mound of frosting; she pulls out the trick candle, still glowing, and stares into it as if studying her fate in the dying trails of smoke. The wick sparks as it tries to relight, and it does for one brief instant before sputtering and finally going out. \n",

I haven't seen Wendy since I left for Sweden years ago, and I could have waited a lot longer, except Peter had this wacky idea that maybe Wendy and I should start dating again. So each of us jump on our magic carpets from a trinity of locations around Rochester and fly in at 6:00 PM sharp. \n",
      "\n",
      "2296 \tWendy gives us both a whopping big kiss on the mouth. She looks great, really great. Her fiery red hair is coaxed into a tense bun, just waiting to spring; a business suit clings tenuously to her Rubenesque figure. She handles an ultraslim cigarette like a pro. But I want to dig through this pleasant topsoil to the wormy loam underneath. \n",
      "\n",
      "2297 \t“So, I heard Rick moved out,” I say. Rick was lover number two after me, a bit of a twit but scored well on the other husband-and-father-to-be categories. \n",

She just said, ‘I'm leaving you, Peter,' like she was reading a name in the phone book. She collected her music, stuffed some of her things in a small suit case, and left without another word. Next day, movers came round for the piano.” I try really hard to be sad for him, but something in his voice, his eyes, or the casual way he sips his drink suggests that the entire incident was more interesting than emotionally crushing.\n",

Seems they hit some bad times for a while. She was laid off, and his business went bust. She lost her home and moved into his sleazy place on Madeira Beach. But then, out of nowhere, she finds this great new job, and he gets this huge contract for some new development in Pasco county. So they buy this huge goddamn place back in Spring Hill, and now she drives a goddamn Mercedes and wears a goddamn diamond big enough to choke Mister Ed.” \n",

I look down and see what looks like a tube attached to the middle of my chest. I open my shirt slightly to examine it and find it divides like tree branches, connecting to a thousand different points over my body. It runs out my shirt, down the bar of the Pittsford Pub, and out the door. As I study this, the tube begins to glow. The light is feeble at first, but grows with a fiery intensity, and with it a nauseating wave of pain. I clutch my chest and try to steady myself from the intense feeling that my soul is being sucked from me and down the mysterious, glowing tube.\n",

Another image flashes into my head. “Oh, Jesus, God. Not that!” I break out into an uncontrollable sweat and run from the bar, dragging my soul tube behind me.\n",

      "2325 \tI look at the clock—11:00 PM. Friday night. I feel a quiet tug and a warm sensation in my groin. We turn out the lights to watch the glowing presence emerge from by body. A wave starts; no pain at first, just a kind of fragile emptiness. The radiance gradually grows as the pain increases. Soon, the entire room is lit with the energy of two bodies as their furious passion draws life from me. The color drains from my face, yet somehow I find the strength to walk from my bed to the mirror where I see shimmering bones through lucid, translucent skin.\n",

As to why only Peter and myself can see and feel it, I can't say for sure. Maybe those closest to you are connected in some way as well.

The wire glows red, then yellow, then a hot white as the visions come at a faster pace, becoming more violent, more aberrant. Waves of pain and nausea flash through me.\n",
      "\n",
      "2346 \t“What do you see?” she asks.\n",
      "\n",
      "2347 \tI grab both her hands and pull her close. “Hold on and find out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2348 \tA moment later, we ride through a storm of images—steam everywhere, blurred visions of bodies clenching then drawing apart, soap, silk, rope, screams. We try to look away but are unable to as we are there with them as their frenzied lovemaking turns increasingly violent. A desperate spurt of blood blinds us and pushes us back to my room, where we watch it travel the length of the wire and erupt, showering us both in a wave of blood and an echo of ecstatic cries. I feel the very organs being sucked from my body and cry out to Amanda who grabs the sticky end of the tube, pulling it from my body. It slithers through her hands like a wounded eel as the wire and the thousands of tendrils shrink back into my body and disappear with a sickening pop.\n",
      "\n",
      "2349 \tThe visions stop. I feel wasted and empty, barely conscious. We sit on the bed and wait in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2350 \t“It's over,” she says quietly. “You're free.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2351 \t“Am I? What about Karen? I should call her, she's in trouble.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2352 \t“No, I don't think she is, at least not yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2353 \tI push myself out of bed and stand in front of the mirror; my body is covered in blood and some sticky, colorless fluid; I smell like sandalwood incense.\n",
      "\n",
      "2354 \t“You don't think so? So where the hell did this blood come from?” I rip my shirt off and throw it in her face. \n",
      "\n",
      "2355 \tAmanda tosses it aside and says in a voice she forces into control, “I think we can both guess the source of the blood, but the question is—was it pain she was feeling, or pleasure?”\n",
      "\n",
      "2356 \tI sit back on the bed and bury my face in my hands. “Not pleasure—it was ecstasy.”\n",
      "\n",

It seems the beer and Seconol have blurred my vision to the extent that all fours now appear as twos. I push the clock out of the way and read Molly's name off the caller ID.\n",

      "2361 \tI answer with a groggy “hello” on the fourth ring.\n",
      "\n",
      "2362 \t“Don? Is that you?” The question seems oddly confusing—up to this moment, Molly and I haven't exchanged ten syllables. “Hello? It's Molly. Don?”\n",

      "2363 \t“Yeah, hi. Molly?” I sound like I'm gargling molasses. “It's late . . . what's up?”\n",
      "\n",
      "2364 \tI sit on my bed, stoned and pouting, my house cluttered with half-full moving boxes destined for New Port Richey, Florida, wondering why Molly would be calling me at this particular time and if this has any connection to the real world. If she's looking for Peter, he's been sleeping with a physically demanding personal trainer named Joyce James, who shrieks snippets from Finnegan's Wake during climax. I don't think I'll mention that.\n",
      "\n",
      "2365 \tAs I ponder this phony bit of existentialism, I hear a loud thud as Molly drops the phone. Instantly I travel through miles of cable to her bedroom, slithering like extruding sausage through the greasy holes of her antique princess phone mouthpiece. \n",
      "\n",
      "2366 \tMy clothes don't endure the trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "2367 \tMolly takes one look at me, covers her mouth, and runs to the bathroom. She falls on her knees in front of the toilet and dry heaves an ounce of saliva and a gallon of air.\n",
      "\n",
      "2368 \t“Christ, do I look that bad?” I say and run to the bathroom to help.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "2371 \t “What do you know? He wanted me to leave!” It sounds like she's trying to cry, but I doubt there's enough moisture in her bulimic body to muster even a single tear.\n",
      "\n",
      "2372 \tI grab a towel from the rack and wrap it around my waist. Molly grips the toilet seat like a life preserver and pushes herself up to her feet. I help her up and lead her back to the bedroom of her cramped, one-bedroom flat. A pale streetlight just outside her window bathes the room in a sallow glow. Her skin shines like a lemon in candlelight.\n",
      "\n",
      "2373 \t“That's not true,” I tell her.\n",
      "\n",
      "2374 \tWe sit side-by-side on the bed. I reach out and brush her face with my hand. An aching energy seeps through my palms, down my arms, and through my body. I draw her close and whisper to her softly, “He loves you, Molly.” \n",
      "\n",
      "2375 \t“He doesn't fucking love me, the son of a bitch. He broke up with me first!”\n",
      "\n",
      "2376 \tI remember those words. Molly looks up and impulsively kisses me gently. I kiss back, mostly a conditioned response. Her tongue circles around the inside of my mouth, over the front of my teeth. Moments later I feel a pleasant, wet warmth between my legs. I lean back, trying to convince myself that I should really be enjoying this. But the feeling dies as quickly as it was born. Her wide, sad eyes look up at me, begging for something I'm not able to give.\n",

      "2377 \t“Is it me?” she asks.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "2379 \tShe lends me a pair of her shorts and one of Peter's T-shirts and makes the perilous journey of twelve miles from Brighton to Webster, a more dangerous method of travel than through telephone wires. We sit and stare at each other as her Audi expels gallons of noxious fumes. \n",
      "\n",
      "2380 \t“You okay?” I ask. \n",
      "\n",
      "2381 \t“Maybe,” she says and gives me a tender kiss on the cheek. She waits for me to say something, her fingers nervously twirling the keys dangling from the ignition. “Aren't you going to ask me in?”\n",
      "\n",
      "2382 \t“I better not. The place is a mess, and I'm moving to Florida in a few days.” It's the best excuse I can invent. \n",

      "\n",
      "2387 \tShe slowly unbuttons her blouse. There's a steady trickle of blood from a small wound no larger than a pinhole centered directly over her heart. Her body shakes beneath a wave of pain. A small tear is finally forced from a spent tear duct and rolls down her cheek. It evaporates before ever hitting the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "2388 \t“It's getting worse,” she tells me.\n",
      "\n",

      "2395 I putter around my newly rented, three-bedroom house, moving bits of relocation here and there, searching for bugs. A small black scorpion scoots out from beneath a United Van storage box and scampers across the floor at a surprising pace. I rush to catch up, hoping to intercept the varmint before it squeezes under one of the numerous cracks in the floorboard. I reach it just in time and heroically stamp the life out of the thing, but not before its stinger reaches around and catches my big toe through open sandals.\n",

      "2397 \tSo this is Pasco County, Florida—just another redneck outpost on the fringe of Tampa Bay civilization. I make my way into the bathroom and swab my throbbing toe in Calamine lotion, mumbling invectives that will no doubt doom me to hell.\n",
      "\n",
      "2398 \tMy phone rings; I answer, expecting a salesperson or Welcome Wagon representative, but am instead greeted by Nancy's cheery voice and a wave of complaints about finding tenants for my place back in Webster. The entire experience moves me to seek another beer.\n",
      "\n",
      "2399 \tSo I do, and before seeking the sanctuary of the comfy chair, I scan the map of Pasco county that the chamber of commerce was nice enough to leave. It hangs on my wall, occupying a place of honor above the fireplace. There is a big yellow pushpin marking my house; another big red pushpin marking Karen and Rick's place about five miles away; and another big blue pushpin, perfectly bisecting the line connecting mine and Karen's house, marking the Winn-Dixie Supermarket and Market Café. And having run out of Coors Light, it is to this market I now must go.\n",

      "2400 \n",

      "2401 \tI navigate the shopping cart skillfully down the narrow aisles, memorizing the placement of favorite foods and beverages. Turning from the snack aisle to the beer cooler, I run into another cart. \n",

      "\n",
      "2403 \tA sweet, familiar voice replies, “Not a problem.” And standing there plastered with smiles is Karen and a large person whom I instantly recognize as Rick. His physique is just a tad stocky, his smile too wide, his face altogether too pretty; he holds Karen like a prized possession. I can't believe he doesn't remember me from the West Wind, but she continues on with him in the opposite direction, like running into a former lover is an everyday occurrence; and considering how good they look together, I conclude that the shower scene Amanda and I witnessed must be an everyday occurrence as well. I mutter a sincere “Well, fuck me,” under my breath and continue up the beer aisle, stuffing an extra twelve-pack of Coors into my cart.\n",
      "\n",
      "2404 \tIn the midst of this pleasant reverie, I realize that the aisle is much longer than expected. It stretches into the distance, converging miles away like parallel railroad tracks. I step up my pace and find myself racing down the aisle, propelled by some hidden engine; the shelves on either side blur like speeding traffic. I break some kind of speed barrier as the lights around me fractures into prismatic colors. Finally I arrive at the entrance of the Market Café where breakfast is being served. Karen is seated at the single table, surrounded by lush vegetation and wildflowers. A single white rose in a glass vase, but nothing else, sits atop the simple wooden table. Karen sits patiently, smiling, barefoot with crimson-painted toenails, wearing a sleeveless white dress.\n",

      "2416 \tWe share an English breakfast of scones with clotted cream, jam, and tea, taking no notice of how the food actually gets there or disappears when we are finished. The rising Florida sun warms us. I reach for her hand; she holds mine for an instant, the sun reflecting off polished ruby nails, but quickly withdraws and reaches for her napkin, taking it off her lap and back onto the table. She stands up, ready to leave, but I remain glued to my chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "2417 \tI struggle to ask the question, but instead phrase it like a statement of fact. “You planned to meet him on our anniversary, and you two arranged that hike.” I take a tentative sip of tea and stare into the cup, “And I think I have a pretty good idea how you twisted your ankle.”\n",

      "2418 \tKaren frowns like a little kid caught stealing cookies. “You don't know the whole story.” She reaches into her purse, finds a small black book, and tosses it onto the table in front of me. “More efficient than the thing you put on my pendant, and if you want to know what really happened . . .” She leaves the sentence unfinished with a little half smile. \n",

      "2421 \t“How did you know about the spy pendant?” I shout out, but she doesn't turn around. I sit with her journal in front of me, afraid to read, but more afraid not to, and turn to a random page. The entry is dated May 4, the day after we arrived at the West Wind for our anniversary. There's no writing in the journal, just a photograph of the four of us: Jean, myself, Karen, and Rick at the head of a path that forks to the right and left. As I stare into the photo, it slowly animates, like an old movie projector warming up. I stare at the images, watching Karen's video diary of that day.\n",

For a long time, it happens just as Rick described it later—they get turned around and end up back at the top of the waterfall. By now, it's late afternoon, the sun is setting, and the waterfall splashes crazy colors like paint thrown onto a wild merry-go-round. They laugh in the cool air; the approaching night is brilliantly lit by the kaleidoscope waterfall. Then without warning, they are in each other's arms, kissing with a desperate frenzy.\n",

      "2425 \tShe writhes in pleasure and says, “We shouldn't be doing this,” but doesn't stop him. Instead, she holds his head closer as he brings her to orgasm. She does the same for him. The explicit images freeze my soul, piss me off, and titillate all at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "2426 \tThey make love in the cool mist. At one point, while against a tree, she twists her ankle against a protruding root; but instead of stopping, they only change positions. Finally they both dive into the waterfall and let the cool water run over their tired bodies. They make love in the showering mist and then relax in a soft patch of grass and moss.\n",

Jean and Karen, in color-coordinated bikinis having the combined area of about a square foot, sit poolside, dangling identically painted toenails in the steamy water. I nurse a Coors Light and attempt small talk with Rick while he decides on a likely course of action; neither one of us mentions the West Wind. \n",

      "2434 \tI had forgotten how big he is—his muscular, six-foot, two-hundred-plus frame, topping mine by seven inches and seventy pounds. Jean smiles at me, foreshadowing a delicate search beneath that petite swimsuit. I crack open another beer and flirt with her, hoping Karen is watching. The conversation eventually drifts to a tepid survey of modern authors. I strike a hot spot with Anais Nin. \n",

She asks me about the small scar on my chest, and I tell her I was accidentally burned; not the truth, but not a lie either. Her beauty, her slim, tanned body, astound me; and I see her wanting, aching for me, her neck arched back waiting for me to explore her perfect breasts with my tongue. Our suits dissolve in the clear, warm water, and as I pull her closer to me, her lips now inches away, I feel the soft, delicate curves of her sex next to mine, when a friendly voice invades the patio.\n",

An errant throw by Karen hits a large, muscular man jogging down the beach. A round of apologies is followed by the man buying Karen and Jean a round of drinks. So that's how they met Rick. The scene fast-forwards to later that afternoon. I'm in Jean and Karen's room; Jean is out on the beach with Rick somewhere while Karen and I frolic in the Jacuzzi tub, making love there, continuing the trail to the bed. She lays before me and opens wide in a passionate act of submission; I take her roughly, and she moans in quiet delight.\n",

Wendy and I stretched out in the sauna and had wet sex in the steam and heat. Standing outside the door is Karen. She listens just long enough and then runs down the hallway, up several flights of stairs to Rick's room. She knocks; he answers the door, and a moment later, Karen disappears inside.\n",

      "2457 \t“And that's how Rick and Jean got together. He took her home, figuring I was a one-night stand. They started dating and got engaged a month later. Next time we met was at the Bed and Breakfast on our anniversary. There was no way we could see each other in Florida, so he planned on meeting me there. I had no idea what would happen, we just wanted to see each other again. It wasn't anything we planned, it just happened.”\n",

Again the images animate, and in the space of a few seconds, I watch the wedding party, the toast, shoving cake in one another's mush, throwing the garter, and all the other customary post-nuptial paltriness. Then the image suddenly fast forwards through several weeks of less-than-blissful married life and resumes normal speed with Karen knocking at the door of some hotel. A tall man with long, dark hair, clad only in spandex briefs, answers the door and ushers her discreetly in like some great puppet master gathering his marionette. His face never appears, but I hear her whisper the name Terry. The images speed through several hours then slow down again as she quietly leaves. \n",

      "2469 \t“I've never skinny-dipped before,” Jean tells me, but strips with an expertise that suggests otherwise. Rick, Karen, and I join in, taking in the late afternoon sun. Beer turns to Sauvignon Blanc, and bottles in hand, we revert to our childhood, splashing and grabbing each other without regard to who is with whom. \n",
      "\n",
      "2470 \tJean takes me to one end of the pool, Rick swims with Karen to the opposite end. He lifts her out of the water, onto the poolside, and begins a slow, languorous journey starting at her toes and inching slowly up. She arches back, drinking in the sensations. Jean distracts me as well, yet my eyes dart between her anxious foreplay and the animated couple opposite us. I try to push the sounds of Karen's rapture from my mind but am unable to stop looking, hoping that her eyes will somehow find mine. I position Jean so I can watch them, then enter her roughly, loudly. She screams in such utter delight that the sun is chased from the heavens and replaced with a blanket of stars and spinning planets. Jets erupt a frenzy of bubbles from the pool that mixes with our own wild thrashing. A cacophony of strange and alien sounds, a choir of angels and demons, permeates our private world and drowns out the ecstatic music of four souls in climax. \n",
      "\n",
      "2471 \tKaren looks up, exhausted; our eyes meet at last, only for an instant, but in that small speck of time we are together again, clenched, inside one another. She looks away, closes her eyes, and even from across the turgid pool flooded with light, I see a small tear, and there on her chest, just between her breasts, a short, glowing tube that breaks out into a thousand invading tendrils. From her hands, arms, and legs sprout fine strings that dance from her body, high into the heavens. I feel a sudden surge of pain and watch in detached horror as the tendrils grow out of my own chest, replacing the scar, forming a glowing tube that floats and bobs in the froth.\n",

      "2472 Cards\n",
      "\n",
      "2473 \tI live with the pain and the glowing extra appendage that over the last three months has stretched out to fifty feet or more. Fortunately, it coils up into a space small enough to fit into the small pouch I have sewn into the inside of each shirt. Jean, and everyone else but Karen, is oblivious. Even while making love, which is fairly often, Jean never notices the thing even as it wraps itself around our bodies, almost in a silent protest. The frequency and intensity of the attacks gradually increase, as if Karen and I are fighting a silent war. One of us will lob a volley of orgasms, piercing the other with spiritual bullets that tear into the heart and bleed the soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "2474 \tWe both endure the pain, but like a pair of obsessive-compulsive athletes, always sprinting, it slowly drains us dry.\n",
      "\n",
      "2475 \tMonday evening. \n",
      "\n",
      "2476 \tThe four of us play hearts every Monday, and after a particularly intense set of weekend skirmishes, Karen and I are exhausted and weak. The cards in my hand swim through my fingers; a randy jack of hearts makes eyes at the queen, and they have sex on the two of diamonds until the king intercedes, cleaving the head off the jack with his double-edged sword. Karen is staring into her own animated hand, no doubt watching some bizarre drama unfold. \n",
      "\n",
      "2477 \tRick and Jean sashay out to the kitchen for snacks and more wine, and in this moment alone, I say, “This is killing us, Karen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2478 \tWe stare at each other's soul tubes, which we have both rolled up into neat piles at opposite corners of the card table. They sit there for the time being, in hibernation until one of us launches a blitzkrieg at the other. She stares at me silently; she has aged—deep lines carve pain into her sallow face. She puts her head down and sobs silently until Rick and Jean return from the kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "2479 \t“What's wrong, sweetie?” Rick asks, tenderly rubbing her shoulder. She wipes her eyes, goes into the bedroom, and closes the door behind her without saying a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "2480 \t“She's been acting funny for weeks now,” he apologizes. Jean nods in agreement. \n",
      "\n",
      "2481 \tWe mumble good-byes, pack up, and drive slowly back to the home we now share.\n",
      "\n",
      "2482 \tThat evening, Karen and I wage an all-out sexual war that lasts until the early morning hours. Rick and Jean leave for work with huge smiles, but we are both too spent to get up and spend the rest of the day in bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2483 Truce\n",
      "\n",
      "2484 \tNext day, Karen calls me at work and asks to meet me for lunch. We converge at TGI Friday's, order a couple of beers, sit across from each other, and stare.\n",
      "\n",
      "2485 \t“Cease-fire!” she says simply.\n",
      "\n",
      "2486 \t“That's not good enough. We need a truce or something. This is killing me. I'm sure it's doing the same to you, and sooner or later, one of us is going to kill the other. What's left to do anyway?” I say in a tired monotone. “We've used every weapon available.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2487 \tThere is a long pause; I can hear Karen thinking, but her mind is completely closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2488 \t“Not quite,” she says at last. “I have one weapon left.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2489 \tI try to think, but my head has leaked any necessary brain power weeks ago. “I don't get it.” \n",
      "\n",
      "2490 \t“I think you get it,” says Karen, interrupting my thoughts. “You were there, months ago with someone else. I could feel your presence somehow. Remember the shower? We came damn close then, right to the edge. I could finish it.” She pauses again, spacing out her thoughts, “I could finish this war for good.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2491 \tIn a flash I see them again, crowding in the shower in the steam and heat. Sandalwood incense catches and rides the steam, filling the small bathroom with waves of strong scent. Jazz music filters in from the living room. The images are blurred, as if looking in through a translucent shower curtain; figures become forms and shadows, but through the haze, I can watch their love making become ever more daring. For a long time I don't understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "2492 \tThen I see the ropes; thin, silk cords around her ankles and wrists securing her to the shower wall. He holds one more, poised for some unknown purpose, as they push each other toward climax. I hear her voice rise in some exotic tongue, a sound I remember. She pants, “Do it. Now!” and just as she reaches orgasm, he wraps the silk cord around her neck, cutting off her breath. She falls forward, unconscious from the intensity of the pleasure. He quickly releases the cord; consciousness returns slowly. She smiles softly before lapsing into a deep, tranquil sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "2493 \tNow I understand. Enhancing orgasm by cutting oxygen to the brain, taking the ultimate step. I can't imagine what has pushed her this far.\n",
      "\n",
      "2494 \tMaybe she sees my thoughts. “I can do it,” she says. “Rick's a strong guy and gets wild during sex. He won't even know what's happening until it's too late.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2495 \t “Don't do it, Karen. You'll kill us both, and what about Rick and Jean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "2496 \t“Civilian casualties,” she says coldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "2497 \t“That's crazy. He loves you. Christ, I love you.” I search for the right words. “Why do you want to do this? It doesn't make any sense.” There is another long silence. “We really are connected. Look at that thing growing out of your chest. What in the hell do you think that means?”\n",
      "\n",
      "2498 \t“I know what it means,” she says, her voice rising in agitation. “You said it yourself. We are connected, I can see that. I don't have any choice in the matter, do I? And neither do you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2499 \t“But it doesn't have to be that way, Karen,” I tell her, almost a plea.\n",
      "\n",
      "2500 \tShe hands me her journal. I open up to a random page that is totally blank, and thumbing through the book, I find that all the pages are blank.\n",
      "\n",
      "2501 \t“They're all blank,” I say, “I don't get it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2502 \t“You will,” she says. “Just watch.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2503 Journal\n",
      "\n",
      "2504 \tI stare at a blank page, expecting some magic to occur, some image from the past to suddenly flash onto the page, but nothing happens. I look up to an empty table, an empty restaurant. I run outside looking for Karen, but the parking lot is empty; no cars are on the road. The sky is crystal clear and quiet . . . more than just quiet—vacant, as if it was teeming with life that was suddenly, inexplicably all carted away in some fast-moving van. I call out to Karen, to anyone, but my voice falls dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "2505 \tStreams of clouds roll in double speed; the sun dips and rises again, over and over. Years, decades, then centuries pass. The once-grand restaurant and all attendant civilization crumble as I watch the landscape slowly taken over by trees and a soft meadow. The motion slows down, and I am atop a rolling hill overlooking an endless stretch of beach dotted with a party of dancers. A plethora of life springs forth, and there in the distance, with her back toward me, is Karen. She is dressed in the same simple white dress she wore at our lunch in London and again in Florida at breakfast. I call out to her. She turns around and slowly approaches me.\n",
      "\n",
      "2506 \t“I still don't get it,” I say, realizing I use the phrase all too often.\n",
      "\n",
      "2507 \t“Look around you. Look at us. Where we are? Don't you recognize it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "2508 \tThe place feels familiar, and just as the thought is about to slip away, she kisses me with an intensity that sends shock waves through my body.\n",
      "\n",
      "2509 \tWe look at each other but remain silent as words suddenly have no meaning. On that lonely hill above an endless ocean, in a different time and place, we are lost to each other. Our thoughts merge like overlapping ripples in a quiet stream, and in that instant, I finally get it. I finally get everything, and the sudden enlightenment rushes through me like a speeding train—Karen, a wide beach, the fable, the limbo dancers, the sky in London, the island where we first found love, pearls, and finally our connection—all of it. It all suddenly makes sense and pierces me like a sword drawn slowly through my body.\n",
      "\n",
      "2510 \tShe looks into my face and sees my revelation, but no words are spoken. I close my eyes and kiss her again. We both disappear into each other, and when we open our eyes, we are sitting across from each other at the restaurant holding hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "2511 \tI slowly adjust back to the present, but like a dream, my flash of enlightenment has scurried away, leaving only a tantalizing glimmer.\n",
      "\n",
      "2512 \t“I had it all figured out. But it's gone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2513 \t“Is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "2514 \tI think for a moment. “No. Not all of it. One image remains. Somehow this connection is more than just something between you and me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2515 \tShe sits silently and listens as I continue my ramblings. “I don't know what more, except that it's somehow important. Something that's followed us around our whole lives. And maybe even before.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2516 \t“Before?”\n",
      "\n",
      "2517 \t“I know, it doesn't make any sense, does it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "2518 \tKaren nods and says, “Don't forget dinner Friday. Come over around six. Rick wants you to bring the wine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2519 \t“You can't do this.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2520 \t“I don't know if I can. I don't know that I won't.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2521 Dinner\n",
      "\n",
      "2522 \t“Pass the salt.” \n",
      "\n",
      "2523 \tI do so, slower than expected. Karen leans forward and takes the shaker like a sacramental. It levitates in her hand. \n",
      "\n",
      "2524 \tShe overseasons her soup.\n",
      "\n",
      "2525 \tI study her. Her beauty is still flawless, still overwhelming. I decide not to remind Karen about too much salt, remembering that she overseasons everything, and instead compliment Rick on a lavish and superb dinner—grilled Cajun swordfish with sautéed broccoli and morels complete a feast that started with French onion soup, Caesar salad, and fresh-baked bread. We sit around an expansive table, the men in black formal attire, the women in designer low-cut dresses, and make small talk, finishing our soufflés and sipping old port. \n",
      "\n",
      "2526 \tOur ever-present tubes are still there, though well hidden in the confines of starched cummerbund and delicate undergarments. Karen and I exchange furtive glances, listening to the quiet singing of the wires to each other's souls.\n",
      "\n",
      "2527 \tThe week-long cease-fire has allowed both of us to regain our strength. There is color in her face and a naughty charm in her laugh. She teases Rick and pours him another drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "2528 \tWe play Trivial Pursuit, Scattergories, and a goofy adult game called Dirty Words. Someone suggests retiring to the patio, so we change into swimsuits and relax by poolside, waiting for a late evening thunderstorm to roll in. The wine and distant echoes of thunder over the gulf lull us into collective coma.\n",
      "\n",
      "2529 \tAround midnight, Karen jumps up unexpectedly, and looking at me says to Rick, “Honey, I feel like a shower. Want to join me and leave these two lovebirds alone?”\n",
      "\n",
      "2530 Shower\n",
      "\n",
      "2531 \tMy heart speeds up; the color drains from my face.\n",
      "\n",
      "2532 \tRick flashes a lascivious smirk and says, “I'm always in the mood for a shower.” He says to Jean and myself, “You two can crash here if you want. We may be a while.” As they leave arm in arm, Karen looks over her shoulder at me and smiles, and I feel the first warning tug of pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "2533 \tMy only thought is—she won't go through with it. Jean flirts, running sharp, polished nails lightly up and down my leg. I close my eyes and sit like a zombie, the hot tube to my soul suddenly growing at a fantastic rate. One hundred, two hundred feet longer until the patio is choked with it. I can feel the end slither into the house through the patio door, searching for its mate. As it enters the bathroom, I am there too, unable to see but hearing each small sound as if some super microphone is embedded in my brain.\n",
      "\n",
      "2534 \t“Anything wrong?” asks Jean when her foreplay has no affect.\n",
      "\n",
      "2535 \t“No, nothing. I just feel . . . just tired is all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2536 \tI hear the water running, and the room fills with hot steam. A hand reaches into a secret place in the vanity and finds five silk cords. Then the sound of knots, gentle but firm, being tied around ankle and wrist. My tube pulsates red and orange; a hot poker of pain stabs me. I double over with a sharp cry. Jean bends over me, worried.\n",
      "\n",
      "2537 \t“What is it? Are you sick?”\n",
      "\n",
      "2538 \t“No. I'm okay. Just leave me alone, please.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2539 \tI listen to their lovemaking. The pace starts slow and easy, gentle, but gradually grows in intensity like a spreading wildfire. The tube changes from orange to yellow, still growing. Another sharp pain, this time barbed claws that reach into my chest and pull out my heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "2540 \t“Karen, don't,” I manage to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "2541 \t“Don't what?” asks Jean anxiously. “What's wrong with Karen?”\n",
      "\n",
      "2542 \tAnother wild flash of pain, my heart and breath pound like a pair of jackhammers.\n",
      "\n",
      "2543 \t“Jesus, Don, what is it? What's wrong?”\n",
      "\n",
      "2544 \tJean's voice fades to static. I struggle to get up, but Karen is a skilled soldier, sending crippling volleys at an alarming rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "2545 \t“Help me,” I plead. “Before it's too late.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2546 \tJean helps me to my feet. A new sound, the sound of silk stretched taut, poised and waiting for the right instant. We make our way from the pool, through the lanai, and into the house. I hear silk sliding around soft skin and Karen's hot breath and racing pulse. Again a white hot spear of pain explodes into my chest and down my legs. I collapse only feet away from the master bedroom. Inside I hear an anxious moan, an approaching climax, and a voice urging, “Do it. Do it now . . .” I struggle to my feet once again, leaning on Jean.\n",
      "\n",
      "2547 \t“Karen, don't,” I scream, throwing my body against the locked door to the bedroom. \n",
      "\n",
      "2548 \tJean panics, “Don, what is it? What's wrong?”\n",
      "\n",
      "2549 \tI throw myself at the door again. Now there is a sound missing, the sound of Karen breathing, and this sends a wave of pain so intense that every cell in my body shudders. Yet it propels me a final time into the door, finally breaking through. Jean follows behind me. I yell, “Rick, let go,” but he can't hear me through the closed bathroom door. On the floor, my tube snakes its way into the shower, now glowing and shooting hot sparks and waves of electricity. Underneath and around the door beyond are lights and colors. Together Jean and I throw open the bathroom door, releasing a cloud of hot steam and a mad rush of wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "2550 \tMy connection to Karen springs ahead of us and finds its mate. Together they intertwine and join, and in that instant, Karen and I merge. I feel the cord tight around my neck, knowing that I have substituted a cord that can't be removed, the same cord that Rick desperately tries to loosen.\n",
      "\n",
      "2551 \tI feel my life fading and meet Karen somewhere beyond time and space. She reaches for my hands, and I take them, but she's slipping away.\n",
      "\n",
      "2552 \t“I was so afraid,” she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "2553 \tA brilliant light radiates behind her, dragging her away. I grip her hands desperately. \n",
      "\n",
      "2554 \t“What was it, Karen? What are you so afraid of?”\n",
      "\n",
      "2555 \t“Love,” she says simply. “The intensity was killing me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2556 \tThe web of connections—suddenly the image is crystal clear, and I too feel a tremor of fear. “We can fight it,” I tell her, not knowing what force it is we're fighting. “Just stay with me.” Her grip gradually loosens.\n",
      "\n",
      "2557 \t“Hold on,” I yell into a huge wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "2558 \tHer eyes meet mine. “I love you so much,” she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "2559 \t“Hold on tight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2560 \tShe clutches desperately, fighting the force that is now dragging us both into the void. Slowly, surely, we slip further and further into it.\n",
      "\n",
      "2561 \tKaren cries out, “You can't hold on. Let go.”\n",

      "2563 \t“No—it's too late.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2564 \tThe word “late” echoes and diminishes as she slips from my hands and disappears into the void. With my last breath, I cry out, “Karen!” I hear a sharp snap and feel the tube ripped from my chest.\n",
      "\n",
      "2565 \tWhen I open my eyes, I'm lying face up on the floor of the bathroom. I must have been unconscious for mere seconds as I see Karen still bound to the shower wall, her head slumped forward, her eyes closed. Around her neck is the silk cord that Rick has at last managed to loosen—Karen had underestimated his strength. Together, Jean, Rick, and I untie the wrist and ankle cords, and Rick caries her into the bedroom, placing her on the bed face up.\n",
      "\n",
      "2566 \tJean barks out instructions, “Dial 911. Hurry!” She leans Karen's head back and pushes breath back into her lungs.\n",

      "2569 \tNothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "2570 \t“Please breathe,” Rick cries as he punches the numbers on the phone next to the bed. He gives the necessary details to the calm voice at the other end. He shouts to us, “Help on the way. They say to keep the CPR and mouth-to-mouth until they get here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2571 \tJean repeats mouth-to-mouth, “Come on, Karen, don't give up.” She returns to CPR, pressing her chest in precise rhythms.\n",

      "2572 \t“Come on . . .”\n",
      "\n",
      "2573 \tShe alternates mouth-to-mouth and CPR. I take over after five minutes to give her a rest, and we repeat the pattern, switching places every few minutes. Finally, after what seems like hours, but is probably no longer than twenty minutes, we hear an ambulance siren outside. Rick runs to the door, and moments later, a pair of paramedics and a cop rush into the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "2574 \t“We'll take it from here,” one of the paramedics says.\n",
      "\n",
      "2575 \tAfter a quick check for heartbeat, they strap on an oxygen mask, wrap her in a blanket, and lift her onto a gurney. The paramedic listens again at her chest. He looks up and says, “We have a heartbeat, but very weak. Husband or boyfriend?”\n",

      "2580 “You're safe now,” I tell Karen through the web of tubes connecting her to various life-support machines. Her eyes grow large as she slowly regains consciousness, scanning the room until they find me. She squeezes my hand and nods off to sleep just as a legion of interns barge in and begin dismantling the plethora of arcane technology that has kept her going for the past week. Her doctor strides in, takes the mandatory pulse, and pronounces her fit to leave in a couple of days.\n",
      "\n",
      "2581 \t“You should go home and get some sleep,” she tells me.\n",
      "\n",
      "2582 \t“I almost lost her,” I say, expecting something soothing in return. Jean stirs from her sentinel on a nearby chair and prods Rick, who is curled up next to her. They lean forward and listen, holding each other close.\n",
      "\n",
      "2583 \t“Yes, we nearly lost her,” the doctor explains. “We literally brought her back from the dead. She had no life signs when the paramedics brought her in, and if you and her,” she says pointing to Jean, “hadn't kept up the CPR, she would be gone for sure. Still, it is an absolutely amazing recovery. Even so . . .” she stops her explanation, searching for the right medical phrase, “even so, without oxygen for so long . . . there should be no permanent damage. Time will tell.” \n",

      "\n",
      "2587 \tI drag my carcass into the nearest waiting room, find the lavatory, splash cold water on my face, and brush my teeth. The only other soul in the room is a dark stranger staring into a tattered National Geographic magazine. His face is hard from several days' growth of coarse beard. I take a seat across from him with every intention of power napping but somehow cannot help glancing up at him every so often.

      "2588 \tSome time later, he bursts back into the room with Karen at his side. I bolt up, but they hardly notice me, and sharing some silent joke, they stretch out on a nearby couch. They kiss, lightly at first, then gradually deeper. He leans back, lights a cigarette, and hands it to Karen who takes a deep drag and blows a cloud of smoke in my direction. They giggle like kids reading porno.\n",

      "2597 Molly leans over the bar at the Penfield Tavern and signals the bartender with a noisy wave of a ten-dollar bill, nearly knocking over her half-filled and slowly warming Guinness into the lap of the porcine man sitting next to her. He exhales plumes of blue smoke and continues his conversation with a bouncy blonde woman whose mind is vacant from too many margaritas.\n",
      "\n",
      "2598 \t“Like I was saying,” he says, flashing an odious grimace at Molly. “The goddamn winters here are hell, really, hell.” The woman nods like one of those bobblehead dogs. He inches closer, elbowing Molly out of the way, when she is at last rescued by a bartender. \n",
      "\n",

A beer appears in a large crystal chalice. It bubbles and shoots fireworks and flames across the bar. The man sitting next to her and his vegetating companion simultaneously breathe in a startled, “what the hell . . .” but Molly continues to stare into the bartender's eyes and run her fingers over his ring. It glows and expands as it heats up to a fiery red, singeing the skin on her fingers, but still she holds on. Inside the vessel of dark stout, a drama emerges—the beer clears to crystal, and a parade of figures appears, all connected by festoons of pulsating threads. She reads the souls of the trapped figures, and a sudden aura of pain flashes through her; a blade of fire shoots through her heart and into her belly.\n",

The blonde woman screams with laughter and points with childish glee at the figure of Molly racing into the ladies room, her hand firmly cupped over her mouth in a vain attempt to stem the rising tide of vomit. It leaks through her fingers as she dashes into the nearest stall and expels quarts of undigested stout into a toilet already clogged with tissue. It feels good.\n",

      "2604 \tIgnoring the complaints of the other occupants, Molly cleans herself up as best she can with double vision. She pushes her way through the crowd to a public phone where she leaves yet another message on Peter's answering machine. She hangs up with a choice selection of obscenities and stumbles out into the Rochester autumn. A gray, overcast sky with the consistency of month-old refried beans clings to her like peasant kids on a Tijuana holiday.\n",

Instead he just sighs as if he were doomed to find her there. He trudges up the pathway to the door, expecting it to be unlocked, and of course, it is. He sighs again as he locks the door behind him. He finds the bathroom in the dark and takes care of some needed business, listening to Molly's labored breathing in the next room. He undresses and slides between silk sheets. Molly stirs, rolls over facedown, and throws her arm over Peter. He moves it gently aside, sneaks out of the bedroom, and stretches out on the couch.\n",

Her face has the pallor of death; colorless blood trickles from the corners of her mouth. \n",

The flame disappears in the hot waves of steam; her hand is coated and burned with black wax. He chucks the candle into the sink, washes her down, and carefully dries her off. She lets him lead her back to bed where she falls asleep, cuddling a pillow like a teddy bear.\n",
      "\n",

But somewhere along the way, things went wrong between her and Rick, and I don't think the fact that he nearly killed her helped any, even though it wasn't his fault. So I did what I should have done years ago and proposed. I'll spare the details. I hate flashbacks.\n",

I pull my head and a couple of cold beers from the fridge and slam the door shut with a well-aimed kick, knocking loose the picture of the two of us secured there with a small watermelon magnet. I put it back in place, taking extra care to skew it a little for a natural look. The cute couple in the photo wave from that mountaintop in Denver, Karen showing off the two-karat oval-diamond ring I gave her the day before, and no doubt planting larceny in the mind of the hiker we snagged to take the shot.\n",

I drive to Newark, pick up my mom, Peter, Molly, Wendy, and Scott. Then the Newark caravan follows me to the agreed coordinates for a rehearsal dinner; Scott can practice the toast on the way.\n",

She reaches under the lounge chair, grabs the phone, breathes an unintentionally sexy hello into the receiver, waits a moment, then disconnects. “Wrong number,” she says, adding, “You need some practice with directions, so you won't get lost getting back to New York.” She stands up, piles the wedding invitations and envelopes into a neat pile, and slips into a pair of sandals. “I'll run off to the store and get you a map,” she says on her way back into the house.\n",

      "2636 \tShe sees my thoughts, smiles, and tells me she forgot to put on panties. To prove the point, she hikes her shorts up a notch or two, just enough to force me into a rubber construction cone. It sails over the top of my SUV and bounces off the hood of a blue Ford Bronco with New York plates following altogether too close. I glance in my rearview mirror, “Damn it,” I say to myself, then pull over while mentally reaching for my insurance card. The Bronco accelerates past us like we a minor annoyance.\n",

I asked you to hold the map.”\n",

      "2639 \tShe looks at me crossly. “You said hold the map, you didn't say anything about looking at it.” She smiles and hikes her shorts up a few inches. I smile back, and out of respect for American truck stops, we properly christen both map and Shoney's parking lot.\n",

I climb back into bed and fall asleep to the soothing sounds of air-conditioning and tractor trailers. A dream passes through me like a silk veil as I hear the couple making noisy love in the room next door. The indiscreet moans become a choir of angels that surround my bed. I bolt up with an uncomfortable hard-on and scan through the tepid darkness; a figure quietly sitting in the chair across the room next to the window comes into focus, peeking through the curtains and smoking a cigarette.\n",

      "2716 \t“The end,” Molly repeats. She stares into his deep green eyes, searching for answers. Something reaches out and pulls her into his soul. The shock of it steals her breath away, and without an instant of thought, she says, “I can't explain this, but I love you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2717 \n",
      "\n",
      "2718 \t“Of course I love you, what kind of a question is that?” Karen turns over, kills the light, and pulls the sheets up around her neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "2719 \t“I don't know. Forget it. It's just that in two weeks we're getting married and—”\n",
      "\n",
      "2720 \t“And what?”\n",
      "\n",
      "2721 \tThe question has no answer, so I roll over and stare up at the ceiling fan and wait until I hear Karen's breathing slow then shift into a steady, dreamy rhythm.\n",
      "\n",
      "2722 \tThe soft pop of a cork wakes me up from a dreamless sleep. I'd know that sound anywhere—a bottle of Napa Valley Chardonnay; so I get up to investigate, and in the dining room, hovered over the dim light of dueling pink candles, is Diane K., Rick, and Jean. I take a seat across from Jean and glare at Diane K.\n",
      "\n",
      "2723 \t“What are you doing here?” I ask. She pours me a glass of wine and ignores the question, which is exactly what I expect her to do; so I ask it again, but not before I sample the crisp vintage.\n",
      "\n",
      "2724 \t“What are you doing here?” I repeat, and after trading glances with Jean and Rick, add, “And why bring them?”\n",
      "\n",
      "2725 \tOn impulse I lean toward Jean, then taking her hand and pulling her toward me, kiss her intensely. Her tongue traces hope along the inside of my mouth, and Rick merely sighs and gulps what's left of his wine, then tops off his glass, emptying the bottle.\n",
      "\n",
      "2726 \t“So you're not a dream after all,” I say to Jean. She sips her wine and licks her lips; Rick stares at me like I'm some kind of alien, so I make a stupid attempt at conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2727 \t“Good to see you, man,” I tell him. “How's it going?” Rick looks toward Diane K. who is apparently the spokesperson for the group. She waves her hand over the candle, and it instantly procreates into a small bonfire on my dining room table; a thick column of black and pink smoke rises and scatters in the currents of the ceiling fan overhead. \n",
      "\n",
      "2728 \t“Karen will have a shit fit,” I tell them. No one seems to give a damn. \n",
      "\n",
      "2729 \tDiane K. finally chimes in after we empty the fourth bottle. “We were in the neighborhood, so we thought we'd stop by and see how the wedding plans were going.” \n",
      "\n",
      "2730 \tShe and Jean smile brightly, as if their names were just announced for some award, but Rick grunts and empties what's left of the fifth bottle of Chardonnay into his glass. None of us are drunk, yet only I seem to hear Karen's voice from the bedroom call out, “Don, are you up? Who are you talking to?”\n",
      "\n",
      "2731 \t“No one, sweetie. I'll be there in a minute.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2732 \tI look anxiously to Diane K. She shrugs and pours the remainder of the wine over the fire, extinguishing the flame. A cloud of steam rises and forms into a small dragon that flies around the dining room then disappears through a wall like some Hollywood ghost, leaving a trail of pink ectoplasm behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "2733 \t“Oh, shit,” I swear to myself, surveying the mess. “You need to go now before Karen finds you here.” \n",
      "\n",
      "2734 \tRick grabs Jean's shoulder and says through a sneer that could peel wallpaper, “He's right, let's go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2735 \tHe stands up, pulling Jean with him, and pours the remainder of a half-filled bottle of wine over the table. It seeps into the tablecloth, turning it a somber pink, and drips onto the carpet in small, effervescent pools. “You just don't get it, do you?” he says to me. A sudden bolt of anger shoots through him. He pushes the chair from behind him and sweeps the empty bottles off the table, across the room, crashing to the floor, and into the hutch.\n",
      "\n",
      "2736 \t“What's going on out there?” Karen cries from the bedroom.\n",

      "\n",
      "2738 \tDiane K. stands up. I look to her and the mess in a panic, knowing that any second Karen will appear and demand some sort of explanation. She hops up on top of the table and with a wave of her hand throws open the window at the far end of the room. As she flies from the table and out the window, her voice fades into the distance, “Use the map!”\n",
      "\n",
      "2739 \tA rush of wind follows her out. This triggers a room-sized thunderstorm that forms above the light hanging over the dining room table. It lasts only a few seconds but does an amazing amount of damage. As the storm subsides, I see Karen standing in the doorway, wrapped in a blanket, staring wide eyed at the carnage, and then at me. I make a useless attempt to tidy up the place but find the task hopeless and give up with a schoolboy shrug. Karen looks like she wants to scream or throw something at me, but she's apparently too stunned to say anything and bolts back into the bedroom.\n",
      "\n",

She hopscotches to avoid the displaced pieces of white rug, stained a dull pink by the wine, but trips over a bucket of wallpaper paste and falls in a heap; her wedding dress just misses falling into the paste.\n",
      "\n",
      "2744 \t“You and your damn parties,” she says crossly. She picks herself up, ignoring my feeble attempts to help, and slugs her stuff out to the car, making sure to slam the door shut behind her.\n",

      "2745 \t“Not a problem,” I say to the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "2746 \tShe reappears but ignores me.\n",
      "\n",
      "2747 \t“So, why do you have to go early? And why drive all that way? Your folks aren't expecting you for three days.” Her plan to drive straight through to New York instead of flying ahead of me as planned strikes me as lunacy, and the host of arguments she made now seem like mental butter.\n",
      "\n",
      "2748 \tShe rolls her eyes and curls her mouth into an impossible frown. “We discussed that,” she scolds. “I told you I have to finish my dress and help my mom.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2749 \tThis seems like a reasonable enough explanation, so I let it pass. “Love you,” I say in the best puppy-dog tone I can muster.\n",
      "\n",
      "2750 \t“Don't push it.” She disappears back into the bedroom for more luggage. “And don't have any more parties,” she adds on her way out to the car.\n",
      "\n",
      "2751 \tI stand there looking like I farted in a crowded elevator and listen to her start the car and race the motor. I wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "2752 \tThe door opens very slightly; through the narrow crack, she leans in, her eyes find me, and for a few moments that seem more like minutes, she simply looks at me—her face showing no emotion but her eyes penetrating me like lasers. “I love you too,” she says, and then quietly closes the door. A moment later, the door opens a crack. “So behave yourself!”\n",
      "\n",
      "2753 \n",
      "\n",
      "2754 \tI send the workers home early, then I pass by the fridge and pick up two beers, taking time to straighten up the magnetically held picture of us, and go on out to the pool. Jean is sitting at the edge, dangling her feet in the water. I pop open a Diet Coke and hand it to her, slower than expected, and wait for the punch line; but she snatches it out of my hand and gives me a look that takes the fizz out.\n",
      "\n",
      "2755 \t“I shouldn't be here,” she says. She downs half the can and wipes her mouth with her sleeve. “I'm the maid of honor, for God's sake.” I put my arm around her and pull her close; she resists a little but still gives me a lifeless kiss. “Jesus, in four days . . .”\n",

      "\n",
      "2762 \tApparently she thinks so as she pulls a set of whiteboard markers from her purse and starts sketching figures in the midair. The ink hovers like thick smoke, and we have to follow it around the pool area; but by the time she's done, she's diagrammed the next few years of our lives, complete with time scale, like one of those historical charts that show when kings died and wars started and what not. I study the drawing carefully—a series of animated, framed images with a date and title underneath, rather like having one's own art museum—and reach an unlikely climax watching the final frames play out. It waves in the gentle breeze that follows the approaching evening then peters out. The dust settles into the pool and spreads out in a lush rainbow that slowly dissolves.\n",

      "\n",
      "2766 \t“Well, don't.” She walks back into the house, and I trail behind her. “My head's pounding—I need to lie down,” she says in a voice barely above a whisper. She walks off in the general direction of the bedroom, undressing along the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "2767 \tI follow cautiously, taking care not to tailgate. As I pass the refrigerator, I take a moment to adjust yet again the picture of Karen and I, still held up there by that ridiculous plastic watermelon. I reach into a cupboard, pull out a bottle of generic sleep-aid headache drugs, and down three blue pills with a mouthful of warm beer.\n",

We elbow our way into a back room near the pool tables, avoiding another party that is going on, and find Molly and Wendy, my two brothers, and Nancy there waiting. Everyone is alternately drunk or lugubrious or both, so I hurdle high past a field of empty beer bottles, dragging Jean behind me, and take a place next to Molly, who is in the middle of a lively conversation with a tall stranger. She waves to me loudly even though I'm only two feet away.\n",

I follow her, taking care to stay out of sight. It wanders on until it reaches a wide beach on the shore of some sea, the same beach that Karen and I found together years before.

      "2845 \t“Of course you don't,” she says and dives back into the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "2846 \tI know better than to try to get back the way I came, so rather than fight the storm, I hike back into the island and eventually find my clothes hanging dripping wet over a tree limb. I dress and continue on the path. The storm eventually subsides to a humid summer drizzle that stays with me until at last I reach the patio of the West Wind. A lone yellow porch light attracts a hoard of moths, the only sign of life. I creep onto the porch and walk through the deserted breakfast nook to the living room. Everywhere are the remnants of a wedding reception, and of the two wedding cakes, one remains. The room is dark and deserted; the clock purrs midnight. Sitting alone in the dark, watching the Kit-Kat's tail swing back and forth, is Jean.\n",
      "\n",
      "2847 \tI sit next to her, still dripping wet from rain, and we watch the clock for several minutes before saying anything. Jean looks at me and says, “You're all wet.”\n",

      "2848 \t“I know. Is Karen mad?”\n",
      "\n",
      "2849 \t“Mad? You wonder if Karen is mad? Why not ask her yourself?” She laughs as if this were a private joke.\n",

      "2850 \t“Where is she—in our room?”\n",
      "\n",
      "2851 \tShe evades my question. “Wendy and everyone else left hours ago. Except for Peter and Molly who are upstairs doing whatever it is newlyweds do nowadays. Scott's curled up with a beer on a sofa.” She breaks out in a manic bout of laughter; I grab her shoulders and pull her toward me.\n",
      "\n",
      "2852 \t“Knock it off, Jean. Now, where's Karen?”\n",
      "\n",
      "2853 \tThe smile jumps off her face. “God, you are so dense! Karen isn't here. She never was here. She married Terry Hancock this morning, and right now she's honeymooning someplace in Aruba. So I don't think she'll be too upset if you're late.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2854 \tAt first I don't believe her—this can't be happening; it's serial crucifixion. She pounded in the nails, yanked them all out, and then pounded them in again in the same holes using bigger nails.\n",
      "\n",
      "2855       “Christ, not again.” I don't know what else to say, so I pull her close, and together we kill time watching Kit-Kat's tail swing in the dead air.\n",

      "2857 \tScott drives us to the Rochester airport the next morning, and along the way, he and Jean explain what they can. The call had come around four o'clock from a hotel in Aruba where Karen and Terry had apparently just been married by a local magistrate. A short apology to the guests was followed by an instruction to give to me one of the presents that she had sent ahead with her mom. Inside was her diamond engagement ring.\n",

      "2858 \tJean and I fly back to Tampa and arrive back to the house late that evening. We stand at the open door in disbelief and walk slowly through a house that is nearly empty—every piece of furniture, every stitch of clothing, everything that was Karen's is gone. On the floor near the fridge is the picture of the two of us in Denver, scratched and marred by a careless footprint. I pick it up and carefully tuck it back underneath the magnetized watermelon, skewing it just a tad to make it look natural. \n",

      "2861 Jean and I plan a karaoke séance to sing in the new year. The idea is this—we hook up a karaoke mic to the stereo, then when a summoned spirit makes an appearance, it answers questions to the tunes of sixties psychedelic rock. I ask Jean how one entices a spirit to sing anything, but she just smiles and tells me not to worry, that everything is under control, and she knows what she's doing. Her grim pronouncement and vacant expression discourages any further conversation, as if this were more than just a party game and an excuse to drink beer.\n",
      "\n",
      "2862 \tWe invite all our friends, and in the spirit (as it were) of the season, pick ten or so guests randomly from the New Port Richey phone book. Peter, Molly, Wendy (sans Mitch), and Jill fly in from Rochester; Scott makes the trip from Alaska. I have a notion to set up Jill with Rick, an idea Jean roundly discourages.\n",
      "\n",
      "2863 \tRick shows up a bit more than fashionably late and enters the house slowly, as if expecting his own ghosts to reappear. He grabs a beer and asks about Karen.\n",

      "\n",
      "2867 \tRick seems content with this explanation. He pokes me in the side and nods toward Jill who is waving from across the room. She bounces over, and I provide introductions. Almost immediately, Jean butts in with some excuse and pulls Rick over to the snack table.\n",
      "\n",
      "2868 \tOnly two of the randomly selected guests appear: a retiree named Art and his effervescent girlfriend, Stacy. Art explains to Scott and I that this is Stacy's seventy-fifth birthday as well as New Year's, and this seemed like an interesting alternative to a singles dance.\n",
      "\n",
      "2869 \tThe new year comes and goes with the usual amount of festivity. We polish off a couple of bottles of brut before Jean announces it's time for the séance. Scott sets up the microphone and queues up a karaoke CD while we all gather in a large circle on the floor around the mic. We alternate boy and girl, an agonizing ritual that eventually ends up as me, Jean, Rick, Wendy, Peter, Molly, Art, Stacy, Scott, and Jill. The lights dim, and from outside the circle, a ring of tall black candles rise up out of the floor. Incense spouts from braziers that grow out of the walls. From the ceiling, a crystalline web emerges and hovers overhead; small creatures dance across it and leave shimmering trails of light. We all join hands as Jean begins the séance.\n",
      "\n",
      "2870 \t“So here's the deal, guys.” She reaches behind her and holds up a party hat. “Inside are the questions we filled out earlier. We'll draw one at random, I'll read your name, and the name of a spirit you want to contact.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2871 \tJill blurts out, “And then what?”\n",
      "\n",
      "2872 \t“And then,” Jean pauses, for the sheer drama it seems. “We wait. If all goes as planned, and if you really believe, the spirit will materialize in front of the mic and sing the answer to your question.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2873 \tJean passes the hat to Stacy who lowers her hand inside as if expecting a snake to jump out. She pulls out a slip of paper and passes back to Jean.\n",
      "\n",
      "2874 \t“This is from Don. He wants to contact the spirit of his grandfather. Mind if I read the question?”\n",
      "\n",
      "2875 \t“Why not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2876 \tJean studies the slip for a moment. Instead of reading the question, she folds it in half and tucks it away in her bra. “We'll talk later,” she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "2877 \t“Are you sure you know what you're doing?” I ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "2878 \t“Of course I know what I'm doing,” she says with the slightest grin. “It's a party game, for God's sake.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2879 \tWe all rejoin hands, and Jean instantly falls into trance. There is a long period of silence as we all watch Jean sway back and forth under the haze of some psychic spell. Her body begins to glow beneath the white sundress she is wearing, and at the same time there is a shimmer of light by the microphone. I stare up at the presence slowly taking shape, expecting to see my grandfather. Instead the figure of a headless woman appears, draped in a silken red gown. She hovers for a moment, and then reaches for the mic with translucent hands that melt into bone as soon as she takes hold. The CD player switches on, and a karaoke arrangement of “Incense and Peppermints” starts at about three quarters of the normal speed. From an unseen mouth, the apparition starts wailing to the music like some sixties black-light chanteuse, uttering words that are not even remotely close to the actual lyrics (which is no great loss) and even lack a resemblance to any known language—sort of a cross between narcoleptic machinery, retrograde liturgical Latin, and a cockfight. The music speeds up. The wailing gets louder and louder until Stacy finally breaks the circle and covers her ears with her hands. At that instant, the CD player ejects the disc. It flies across the room in a streak of fire and explodes on the far wall, showering us with plastic confetti. The creature expands; its head becomes suddenly visible as a random collection of body parts covered with thick black hair. Several of the drooling mouths issue sharp serpent tongues that dart over our guests. The thing starts to spin, creating a small whirlwind in the center of the room, and then evaporates in a plume of red smoke.\n",

      "2880 \tWe all sit dead still for a moment; Scott starts laughing, followed by Wendy, then Jean, and before long we are all laughing like maniacs.\n",

      "\n",
      "2883 \tBeers all around and a bit of cleanup before we sit back down to summon the second spirit. Again the hat is passed, this time to Jill, who selects a slip of paper and hands it to Jean. She reads the question and then looks at Rick.\n",
      "\n",
      "2884 \t“This is from Rick,” she says slowly. “Rick, she isn't . . .”\n",
      "\n",
      "2885 \tHe interrupts, “I'm guessing you can summon the spirit of the dead or the living, right?”\n",
      "\n",
      "2886 \tJean sighs and drops her shoulders. She crumples the paper in her hand and says, “Rick wants to contact the spirit of Karen. Are you sure about this?” she asks in an icy tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "2887 \t“Yeah. Like you say, it's a party game.”\n",

      "2888 \t“Right. Scott, change the CD.”\n",

      "2890 \tAs before, Jean falls into a trance that spreads to each person in the circle. The CD player starts, and “Unchained Melody” washes over us like a soft breeze. \n",
      "\n",
      "2891 \tWhen we open our eyes, we're on a hilltop overlooking the same beach we discovered at the West Wind. The sun burns high and bright overhead, and sitting cross-legged in the center of the circle in a bikini is Karen.\n",

      "2892 \tShe looks at me with a crooked half smile. “Sorry about the wedding. Let's go for a swim.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2893 \tKaren stands up and bolts down the hill toward the water. Everyone around the circle sits dead still except Rick, Jean, and myself. We follow Karen to the beach; Rick and Jean wade into the warm surf. I stand at the water's edge next to Karen and watch the small waves circle around our feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "2894 \t“You're not really here, and none of this is happening,” I say without looking at her. “Anyway, this was Rick's question, not mine.”\n",

      "2896 \t“Okay, I give up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "2897 \tShe gives me one of those scolding ex-girlfriend kind of looks. “Nothing you don't already know.” She interrupts me as I'm about to ask the obvious follow-up question. “I can't stay long.”\n",

      "2898 \t“Surprise!” I don't even try to hide the sarcasm.\n",

      "2907 \t“Are you happy?” she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "2908 \tI think hard about this. The sound of the surf and Karen's soft voice slowly melts away and dissolves into “Unchained Melody.” I open my eyes to the center of my living room, to a circle of friends who seem lost in their own thoughts, and a microphone that has crumbled into a pile of dust.\n",

A year since we've seen each other and all she has to say is two sentences written in an unsteady script—“Don, meet me in the lobby of the Tampa Museum of Art on Sunday, July 13, at noon. Love to Jean, but please come alone.” \n",
      "\n",
      "2912 \tI check my watch again—nearly half an hour late. I decide to give her until one o'clock and kill time by browsing through the art books and souvenirs in the museum's gift shop. I leaf through the official book of the current exhibition, The Stages of Modern Art from Monet to Lichtenstein. It costs twelve bucks, so I decide to skip the book and instead grab the free pamphlet that covers the same thing in a considerably abbreviated form (the Monet print is the size of a postage stamp). \n",
      "\n",
      "2913 \tI pace around the store to take the edge off, scanning the shelves for an interesting gift for Jean. There's the usual cheesy assortment of key chains, pencils, puzzles, T-shirts, mouse pads, and games. It seems a travesty to waste a perfectly good print of The Persistence of Memory on a mouse pad, and as I turn in search of the good-taste section, I bump into Karen.\n",
      "\n",
      "2914 \tHer smile nearly causes whiplash; she gives me a warm hug and a light kiss on the cheek. I take her hands and stand back just looking at her. She seems thinner than I remember, but it has been a while. And the dark rings under her eyes—that may be a trick of the light or too little makeup. Her hands feel slightly cold, but that's probably the air conditioning. The glasses are new. I don't remember her ever wearing glasses when we were together. Well, people change, so I decide that overall, she looks pretty good, and I tell her so.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "2922 \tKaren doesn't answer, so I face her and repeat myself; she watches my mouth carefully. She smiles and her eyes brighten up; she nods in a way to suggest that life is perfect, but the smile soon disappears as she returns to studying the painting.\n",
      "\n",
      "2923 \tI take her shoulders and lightly turn her toward me again; she doesn't resist but lets me turn her as if she had no choice in the matter. “Say something, Karen,” I tell her firmly. “Tell me what's going on. How the hell did you ever end up marrying Terry Hancock?”\n",
      "\n",
      "2924 \tSilence. The cathedral reflects from her moist, unblinking stare. She tries to form words, but nothing happens. I grip her tightly, pull her close, and say louder, “Talk to me.”\n",

With oil pastels by my side, I alternate between small mouthfuls of a cheese sandwich and tentative sketches of the great façade cloaked by fog and dew. Line and color blend into vague shapes that rise in the mist and blend into a gray, unfeeling sky. As I study the drawing, a woman's face slowly emerges from the stones. It leaps out of the canvas, wailing like a lost spirit. Stunned by the vision, I tear the page from my sketchbook, wad it into a tight ball, and toss it into the river. I cross the river over a narrow bridge and follow the path through the courtyard to the West Façade where I pause at the central portal. The souls of the dead, frozen in stone on the bottom lintel, fly from their tombs at the blowing of the final trumpets.\n",
      "\n",
      "2928 \tUnder the stony gaze of apostles and martyrs, I pull the wooden door open and slip inside. I peer down the nave through the darkness at the small group assembled at the altar. A bishop, wearing an outrageous miter that towers several feet over his head, is conducting a wedding. The ceremony is soon over, and the couple, the bishop, and two altar boys form a solemn procession down the long aisle. As they pass me, the group stops; the man turns his bride toward him and lifts the veil. The bride is Karen. She smiles at her husband, and they share a lingering kiss. He sends the procession ahead and waits until they disappear through the fog. A young woman sitting in a pew across from me catches his attention. She smiles through ringlets of blond hair that circle her face like a halo of angels. I recognize her face and try to call out, but Molly's name wedges in my throat. The groom approaches her, and they talk for a few moments. I creep up several pews ahead of them and try to listen in, but all I can hear is layers of whispers. From the choir behind me, the great pipe organ begins an atonal fanfare. As if smitten with a sudden, irrational passion, they remove the bare minimum of clothing and have sex in the pew. I can't see a thing, but I can hear them tease each other like a pair of naughty teenagers. Molly screams out in climax. After he is satisfied, the man dresses quickly and runs out to meet his bride. His lover buries her face in gloved hands and pathetically weeps to the organ's insane melodies. I creep closer, one pew at a time, and slide in next to her. At first she seems not to notice me, but continues sobbing. I reach out carefully so as not to alarm her. As I am about to touch her shoulder, Molly suddenly looks up, her face lined with rage. \n",
      "\n",
      "2929 \t“This is your fault!” she hisses. With shocking speed and strength, she grabs my wrist and twists my arm down over the back of the pew, snapping the joint. I scream in pain and make a feeble attempt to strike back with my free arm, but she blocks the blow as if I were a child. She makes a fist and takes aim but stops suddenly.\n",

      "2930 \t“Not you,” she says looking past me. “He's mine.”\n",
      "\n",

      "2938 \tOur wedding would have been nice; a double-ring ceremony with Peter and Molly. We had booked the bed and breakfast where we first met.

After hours of running and nearly dead from exhaustion, we reach an open plaza dominated by a low, gray building; at the base is an arcade around the perimeter of the building set off by columns. We run from the street to the protection of the canopied walkway and are lucky enough to find a tavern.\n",

In the distance, we hear a small voice laughing, so we step out to investigate. A young woman clad in a loose-fitting sundress chases a hoop down the street with a stick, giggling to herself as she scores points in some unknown game.

His form disappears, and moments later, Karen stumbles back into the open, waving her hands in front of her, blood running like tears from her eyes.

Molly trudges forward, pushing her way through the crowd, until she meets a nurse at the entrance who, putting a protective arm around her, guides her into the clinic where she drowns in a sea of forms. Another nurse spouts legalese that translates roughly into moral alternatives, none of which make any sense to Molly. She takes a seat and waits patiently for the blood test and weigh-in, until at last she is led into a small, brightly lit room where she undresses, dons a generic hospital gown, and is finally helped into a hopelessly uncomfortable bed, her feet placed wide apart into shiny metal stirrups. She watches the minutes tick by, singing hymns to herself in her head. A woman doctor arrives, offers apologies for being late, and chats away in soothing abortion doublespeak. Molly looks up into the glaring light overhead and counts the angels that circle there. \n",

It eases her back to the edge of sleep when the music abruptly changes to a twelve-tone nightmare, as if the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are running insane over the piano in the next room.

She digs out her calligraphy pen from under the piano stool, writes the title “Fugue” at the top of the page, signs her name, and picks her favorite key of B-flat minor. A melody swirls into her head. Slowly at first, it picks up speed and volume as it weaves a dense texture with other melodies. In a losing race with her own thoughts, she composes a short fugue, eventually abandoning conventional musical notation just to get it all down. Smiling over her work, she lifts the lid, places her hands on the keyboard, and without a thought to how she is doing it, dances on the keys, playing the first twelve-measure phrase repeatedly without error, adding lyrics that she sings to some other tune, “I'm leaving you, Peter, bye-bye.” \n",

The place is something of a downtown Rochester landmark, boasting reincarnations as a hippie coffee house (1968), disco deli counter (1976), punk dance club (1981), university Cabaret Voltaire (1990, named after the Zürich cabaret that launched the Dada art movement), and today as a neighborhood bar and grill. It has a single eight-foot slate pool table with cheesy gold-colored felt, a genuine repainted antique with webbed pockets. The table is strategically located in the center of the place, just close enough to the barstools and walls to prevent making anything but the simplest of shots, which in most cases doesn't matter anyway as the few locals who do wander into the place prefer to use the cues as makeshift weapons.\n",

She kisses him deeply, as if sucking the life from him, letting his anxious tongue explore her mouth. They separate and she lets a glistening drop of saliva drop from her tongue onto his. Before he can follow up, she pushes him away with an exaggerated, dramatic gesture worthy of any soap opera. \n",

She walks inside, sets her purse down, grabs a bottle of mineral water from the fridge, and sits at the breakfast bar in the kitchen, waiting. The cool liquid burns a trail down her throat; a small stab of discomfort in her chest grows and throbs with each sip. She clutches her chest as the pain intensifies, pulsing with each quickening heartbeat. Inside her yellow sundress, a pinpoint of red light appears and gradually spreads, outlining her veins and arteries like a day-glow map. The glowing red light, the color of hot blood, becomes brighter until it shimmers from beneath her dress and showers the room in a neon brilliance; and with it comes the pain—a million barbed needles, each one working in and out of her flesh. She desperately fights back tears but rips off her dress and swimsuit like it were a living iron maiden. Her naked body is a river system of flowing red pain, and growing there, out of the middle of her chest, is the hungry connection of Rick's soul to hers.\n",
      "\n",
      "3136 \tThe pain becomes unbearable. She falls to the floor, doubled over in agony; the seething tendrils bore deep into her flesh, forcing out tiny droplets of blood and sweat. She inches her way across the floor, leaving a trail of fresh blood.\n",

      "3137 \tOne final surge of energy forces a desperate scream from her wasted body. Summoning all her strength, a strength she gathers from some vestige of Rick, she pushes herself up, emits a piercing, gurgling wail, then falls over into a dead sleep. Slowly, almost imperceptibly, the fiery red glow diminishes to a dull flicker then goes out. The tube shrinks and dries out to a brittle, hollow stem.\n",

      "3138 \tJean wakes up with the taste of rained-out carnival in her mouth and slowly climbs back to her feet. She leans against the breakfast bar and looks down at her nude, blood-stained body and the dried-out appendage sticking out of the middle of her chest, between her breasts like a roasted chili pepper. She snaps it off like a twig off a dead tree. It separates cleanly, leaving a small circle of red powder on her chest that brushes away without a trace. She leaves it on the counter and slips her dress back over her head with a resolved sigh and a quiet “Oh, shit” mumbled under her breath.\n",

The clock on the mantle across the room sweeps the seconds away, each tick the terrified screams of a thousand lunatics. A small tear escapes and courses down her swollen cheek over layers of thick makeup; she quickly brushes it aside. Under the clock is a small table, and on that table a digital gamble in the shape of a telephone. She stands up as if preparing to face a firing squad, counts her steps to the phone, stares at it waiting for the right instant. It comes as the clock chimes the hour, 8:00 PM. She lifts the receiver and dials a Florida number. It rings once. “Please, please be home,” she prays. Two rings. Three.

Afterward she washes out her mouth several times, brushes her teeth, and examines the wounds on her face and the burn on her shoulder. Fortunately they're not serious; he knows how and where to hit, a little makeup and no one will notice. Wendy crawls back into bed, but only long enough to remember, finally, where she hid the key. She bounds out of bed and leaps downstairs to the bookcase in the den. In the back row on the top shelf, she finds her well-worn copy of an old novel, Chasing the Meridian, and there, taped in the middle of the first page of chapter thirteen, is a thin gold-plated key. She removes it carefully and replaces the book in exactly the position she found it, as she had no idea to the extent of Mitch's paranoia and what he may or may not have memorized. Next, to the basement where she finds a stack of boxes still packed from her last move, and in the bottom of the box marked “Old Books,” she finds a locked yellow and pink diary from high school. The key fits perfectly. Inside the hollowed-out book is a small, cerulean-colored glass vial of physostigmine, a poison she understands.\n",

Oh my, where are my sisters?\n",

      "3211 \tWhen she doesn't answer right away, he moves into the room like a wounded tomcat.

He speaks; the words spin around the room before finally hitting her consciousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "3212 \t“I was a little hard on you last night,” he says, voice without color. She remains as one trying to mentally kill oneself, in a small, gray room, holding a blade, drawing the fresh bright blood from the arteries in her wrist.

Sounds like a song.” He pulls in a suitcase from behind him, picks it up, and drops it for effect. She stirs beneath the safety of the bed covers. “Really. I'm leaving. Right now. You can go to your Don or whoever. I don't want to hurt you anymore.” \n",

Yet from somewhere deep in my head, I see a strange face through a pinhole and hear a little girl screaming, “you did this.” Suddenly it all makes sense, and it's so obvious.

      "3482 \tAt 6:00 PM the next day, I'm sitting at an oblong table in the center of the Barnes & Noble bookstore on Jefferson Avenue, not far from RIT. There's a pile of books to my left, a poster of yours truly on my right. Behind me, looking over my shoulder, are two oversized cardboard stand-ups of my book covers—Chasing the Meridian and Followed By Madness. They both have a fractal theme, something I thought pretty clever at the time, except most people have no idea what a fractal is. So maybe weaving fractals into the Chasing story line wasn't such a hot idea after all.\n",

To my good friend fill-in-the-blanks?” I get as far as writing “To my good” before I stop, as if someone shot my hand with a nail gun.\n",

We arrive early Saturday morning, and the first thing she does is study the doormat.\n",

      "\n",
      "3511 \tA moment later, the door flies open, and standing there is a slender, young woman who looks to be in her early thirties. She's dressed casually in jeans and a loose-fitting sweater. Her eyes sparkle behind thick glasses with skinny black rims. She has light brown hair circling her face like a living picture frame and the delicate features of a greeting-card angel.\n",
      "\n",
      "3512 \t“Donald and Vickie, am I right?” She hugs us both as if we were lost kin. “Come on in.” She leads us through a modern kitchen into a sitting room. I don't remember the kitchen, but the sitting room looks familiar. “My name is Gwynn,” she says with a hint of a giggle. Vickie and I sit on the couch, Gwynn sits across from us in a rocking chair.\n",

      "3520 \t“Just a small group of friends. After we got your e-mail about using the West Wind in your stories and novel, my mom and I thought it would be good publicity.

      "\n",
      "3523 \tGwynn gives us a little tour of the place, ending at our room, conveniently named Room Two. It has a balcony, a queen-sized bed, and a futon. I make the noble gesture with, “I'll take the futon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "3524 \tVickie nods absently. “So is this where you stayed?” She's read “Breakfast,” so I know exactly what she's talking about.\n",

      "\n",
      "3526 \tI am such a good liar. Every detail of that weekend popped back into my head the instant I entered the room. I can't look at the bed, not yet. I turn away, walk over to the window, draw the blinds, and pretend to look out the window.\n",

      "3537 \tSlow going as the terrain is rough and the trail narrow. We hike about a half a mile single file through Taughannock Falls State Park until reaching the overlook on Gorge Road. Somewhere along the way, the sky turns dark, the temperature drops ten degrees, and we climb the last few hundred yards in a cold drizzle. We take shelter under a large park-information sign, flapping our arms and blowing into our hands to try and keep warm.\n",

      "3543 \t“You're guilty of being human.” I don't have an answer to that. She interrupts my train of thought. “You can cherish the memories, but you need to bury the past.” I nod in tacit agreement. “No, really. Figuratively and literally.”\n",

      "3544 \t“Literally?”\n",

The light mist is persistent, the cold seeps into our bones, and neither one of us says a word until reaching the patio of the West Wind, tired and wet. We walk through a dark kitchen to the guest sitting room. I half expect to see Wendy waiting there with suitcases in hand. Instead we find Gwynn sitting in the same rocking chair, snuggled up close to the fireplace, reading. The flickering flames send shadow demons racing around the walls. We park on opposite sides of a love seat.\n",

      "\n",
      "3549 \tThat evening, before the guests arrive, we borrow a shovel, and in the tepid light of a full moon, we locate the hiking path. We find a clearing about twenty yards from the trailhead, and I dig a hole roughly a foot across and two feet deep. When done, I toss the shovel aside and stand there looking into the hole.\n",

      "\n",
      "3551 \t“Cute. Well, then, here goes.” I reach into my pocket and pull out a folded copy of “Breakfast” I had torn out of my own copy of the book. “This is really corny.”\n",
      "\n",
      "3552 \t“Go on,” Vickie urges. I toss the paper into the hole and quickly cover it up. “There, was that so hard?”\n",

      "3555 \tBack home, the next week races by in a blur. If I hadn't gotten Karen's e-mail reminder on Thursday, I'd have forgotten all about our lunch date the next day. The drive is crosstown from Tampa to Feather Sound in St. Pete. I leave work late, in a rush, forget the directions, and by the time I pull into the Panera Bread parking lot it's 11:45. No sign of Karen yet, so I stand around outside looking hopeful, holding a copy of Followed By Madness and a hardback edition of Chasing the Meridian . It's nearly noon by the time she shows up. She greets me with a small smile and a handshake which derails my initial plan of a friendly hug.\n",

      "\n",
      "3558 \tWe wait in line for a table another ten minutes or so, making work-related small talk. Karen had actually worked for me at one time; not the cleverest idea on my part, but since then her career had progressed. Now, as a director for a medical software company, she seems preoccupied.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "3560 \t“Just a coffee for me.” She looks at me and says with the serious half smile, “Sorry, but I need to get back.”\n",
      "\n",
      "3561 \t“Make that two,” I tell the waiter. “No problem.” Another little fib, and I realize I'm repeating myself. I set the two books on the table. Karen glances at them, and then at me.\n",

      "3562 \t“Finally done,” she says.\n",

      "3563 \t“I started Chasing from scratch a couple years ago.” It sounds like an apology. “The stories, well, you know, I've been working on those for a while.”\n",
      "\n",
      "3564 \tOur waiter arrives with two coffees. He asks if there's anything else and then leaves the check after Karen shakes her head. She immediately reaches over and picks up the bill. That's when I notice her diamond ring. As Karen fishes out a credit card, the waiter returns with a three-foot-long sword that he plunges into the center of my back. The blade exits out my chest, just below the sternum. Karen quietly pushes the bill back in the waiter's direction, ignoring the steady stream of blood dripping onto the table from the tip of the sword.\n",

      "3565 \t“Fifteen years?”\n",
      "\n",
      "3566 \t“Maybe longer. Some of those date back to the late eighties. But I'm done, and now I'm doing a little promotional tour.” She glances at her wristwatch with a frown and cranes her neck searching for our waiter.\n",
      "\n",
      "3567 \t“That's what you said.”\n",
      "\n",
      "3568 \t“This is funny—I was working on them while I was in Wales. We were on the phone. You said, ‘I'll go on tour with you.' Remember that?”\n",

      "3569 \t“Not really.”\n",
      "\n",
      "3570 \tThe waiter drops by with her credit card and another sword. As Karen signs the bill, he runs the sword through my lower neck. It must pierce a major artery or vein as the blood shoots in hot spurts to a neighboring table.\n",
      "\n",
      "3571 \t“Funny how things work out, I guess. So, you wanted to talk about something, right? Did you read the novel?”\n",
      "\n",
      "3572 \t“I read the sample chapters and stories on your Web site.”\n",
      "\n",
      "3573 \t“You know about my site?”\n",

      "3574 \t“You sent it to me. Don't you remember?”\n",
      "\n",
      "3575 \t“Well, I wasn't sure, so I brought copies of both.” I nudge the books in her direction. She doesn't look at them.\n",

      "3577 \t“Really? I'm sorry, why?”\n",
      "\n",
      "3578 \t“What kind of question is that?” Her voice cuts into the lunchtime chatter. “Why do you think?”\n",

      "3579 \t“I don't know. I mean—they're just stories. Right?”\n",
      "\n",
      "3580 \t“You wrote about us, graphically! And used my name, and Terry, and Rick, and Wendy, and Jean, and even my hometown. He's ready to strangle you. It took days to calm him down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "3581 \t“Karen, look, I apologize. It never occurred to me—I mean, you read “Breakfast” years ago. There's no surprise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "3582 \t“Not for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "3583 \t“But doesn't that mean anything to you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "3584 \tShe answers quietly, without looking at me. “Maybe it did, a long time ago. But that's not the point.” She pauses, collects her purse, and stands up. “You need to get rid of anything that might connect me with your books. I don't want to make any trouble for you. I'm content now and don't need the drama, but I can and I will if I need to.”\n",
      "\n",
      "3585 \tI wait painfully long to reply. “I can make the changes. No problem. I've already distributed a bunch of copies. I guess I could get those back. All I can say is, I'm really sorry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "3586 \tHer cell phone goes off. The ring tone is “Unchained Melody,” so I can pretty much guess who the caller is. She glances at me with an embarrassed half smile before she answers. “Hello.” \n",
      "\n",
      "3587 \tGoddamn it, I recognize that lilting voice, the come-hither way she says “hello.” The waiter must recognize it as well. He approaches our table holding a large cleaver. Karen turns away, trying to be discreet while she talks, I guess. “We're at Panera Bread . . . Yes . . . I will . . .” a longer pause. She looks up for a moment and then whispers loud enough for the waiter and I to hear. “Of course I do . . . Okay . . . Love you too. Bye.” \n",
      "\n",
      "3588 \tThe waiter shakes his head. He looks at the cleaver one more time before burying it in my skull. “Anything else, ma'am?” he asks Karen.\n",
      "\n",
      "3589 \t“No, thanks.” \n",
      "\n",
      "3590 \tHe picks up the signed copy of the check and leaves with a curt thank-you. \n",
      "\n",
      "3591 \t“Sorry,” she says to me. Funny she doesn't notice the cleaver sticking out of the top of my head. \n",
      "\n",
      "3592 \t“No problem. Was that Adam?”\n",
      "\n",
      "3593 \t“Of course it was. Look, I need to go, but just for the record, you really did break up with me first. You proposed—we were supposed to get married. Remember?” There's an angry edge to her voice. “And then you backed out for no reason. You know all that, so why did you make me the bad guy?”\n",
      "\n",
      "3594 \t“Karen, they're only stories.”\n",
      "\n",
      "3595 \t“I'm supposed to believe that too? You forget I'm a real person with real feelings. I'm not an excuse for your shortcomings or the means for your own personal catharsis.”\n",
      "\n",
      "3596 \t“Okay, okay. I'll change it around.”\n",
      "\n",
      "3597 \tShe just stares at me, and I have no idea whatsoever what's going on inside her head. Hey, maybe that's the problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "3598 \t“It doesn't matter. Look, there's one more thing. I'm not trying to be mean, but I don't know any nice way to say this, so I'll just say it. You need to stay away from me. Don't call, don't e-mail. I'm married and I don't want any baggage from my past to interfere. I need to get back to work.” \n",
      "\n",
      "3599 \tShe turns and hurries away, leaving me sitting there with a couple of signed books, a cleaver in my head, and a pair of swords sticking out of my body. I flip Chasing open to the title page and read the dedication I had written that morning, \n",
      "\n",
      "3600 \n",

      "\n",
      "3603 \tThe same waiter stops by my table. No sword this time, but he reaches down, thrusts his hand into my chest, and pulls out my heart.

Even at that distance, she can hear his labored breathing and see the ring of sweat under each arm. He stops in front of room 242 and fumbles for a key.
